<p><span class="bold">LURAY CAVERN,<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> a large cave in Page county, Virginia,
U.S.A., 39° 35&prime; N. and 78° 17&prime; W., near the village of Luray,
on the Norfork &amp; Western railway. The valley, here 10 m.
wide, extends from the Blue Ridge to the Massanutton Mountain.
The ridges lie in vast folds and wrinkles; and elevations in the
valley are often found to be pierced by erosion. Cave Hill,
300 ft. above the water-level, had long been an object of local
interest on account of its pits and oval hollows or sink-holes,
through one of which, on the 13th of August 1878, Andrew
J. Campbell and others entered, thus discovering the cavern
now described.</p>

<p>The Luray cavern does not date beyond the Tertiary period,
though carved from the Silurian limestone. At some period,
long subsequent to its original excavation, and after many
large stalactites had grown, it was completely filled with glacial
mud charged with acid, whereby the dripstone was eroded into
singularly grotesque shapes. After the mud had been mostly
removed by flowing water, these eroded forms remained amid
the new growths. To this contrast may be ascribed some of the
most striking scenes in the cave. The many and extraordinary
monuments of aqueous energy include massive columns wrenched
from their place in the ceiling and prostrate on the floor; the
Hollow Column, 40 ft. high and 30 ft. in diameter, standing erect,
but pierced by a tubular passage from top to bottom; the
Leaning Column nearly as large, undermined and tilting like
the campanile of Pisa; the Organ, a cluster of stalactites in the
chamber known as the Cathedral; besides a vast bed of disintegrated
carbonates left by the whirling flood in its retreat
through the great space called the Elfin Ramble.</p>

<p>The stalactitic display exceeds that of any other cavern known.
The old material is yellow, brown or red; and its wavy surface
often shows layers like the gnarled grain of costly woods. The
new stalactites growing from the old, and made of hard carbonates
that had already once been used, are usually white as snow,
though often pink, blue or amber-coloured. The Empress
Column is a stalagmite 35 ft. high, rose-coloured, and elaborately
draped. The double column, named from Professors Henry and
Baird, is made of two fluted pillars side by side, the one 25 and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span>
the other 60 ft. high, a mass of snowy alabaster. Several
stalactites in the Giant Hall exceed 50 ft. in length. The smaller
pendants are innumerable; in the canopy above the Imperial
Spring it is estimated that 40,000 are visible at once.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;cascades&rdquo; are wonderful formations like foaming
cataracts caught in mid-air and transformed into milk-white or
amber alabaster. The Chalcedony Cascade displays a variety of
colours. Brand&rsquo;s Cascade, the finest of all, is 40 ft. high and 30 ft.
wide, and is unsullied and wax-like white, each ripple and
braided rill seeming to have been polished.</p>

<p>The Swords of the Titans are monstrous blades, eight in
number, 50 ft. long, 3 to 8 ft. wide, hollow, 1 to 2 ft. thick, but
drawn down to an extremely thin edge, and filling the cavern
with tones like tolling bells when struck heavily by the hand.
Their origin and also that of certain so-called scarfs and blankets
is from carbonates deposited by water trickling down a sloping
and corrugated surface. Sixteen of these alabaster scarfs hang
side by side in Hovey&rsquo;s Balcony, three white and fine as crape
shawls, thirteen striated like agate with every shade of brown,
and all perfectly translucent. Down the edge of each a tiny
rill glistens like silver, and this is the ever-plying shuttle that
weaves the fairy fabric.</p>

<p class="pt2">Streams and true springs are absent, but there are hundreds of
basins, varying from 1 to 50 ft. in diameter, and from 6 in.
to 15 ft. in depth. The water in them is exquisitely pure,
except as it is impregnated by the carbonate of lime, which
often forms concretions, called according to their size, pearls,
eggs and snowballs. A large one is known as the cannon ball.
On fracture these spherical growths are found to be radiated in
structure.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Calcite crystals, drusy, feathery or fern-like, line the sides and
bottom of every water-filled cavity, and indeed constitute the substance
of which they are made. Variations of level at different
periods are marked by rings, ridges and ruffled margins. These are
strongly marked about Broaddus Lake and the curved ramparts of
the Castles on the Rhine. Here also are polished stalagmites, a
rich buff slashed with white, and others, like huge mushrooms, with
a velvety coat of red, purple or olive-tinted crystals. In some of
the smaller basins it sometimes happens that, when the excess of
carbonate acid escapes rapidly, there is formed, besides the crystal
bed below, a film above, shot like a sheet of ice across the surface.
One pool 12 ft. wide is thus covered so as to show but a third of its
surface. The quantity of water in the cavern varies greatly at
different seasons. Hence some stalactites have their tips under
water long enough to allow tassels of crystals to grow on them,
which, in a drier season, are again coated over with stalactitic
matter; and thus singular distortions are occasioned. Contiguous
stalactites are often inwrapped thus till they assume an almost
globular form, through which by making a section the primary
tubes appear. Twig-like projections, to which the term <i>helictite</i>
has been applied by the present writer, are met with in certain
portions of the cave, and are interesting by their strange and uncouth
contortions. Their presence is due to lateral outgrowths of
crystals shooting from the side of a growing stalactite, or to deflections
caused by currents of air, or to the existence of a diminutive
fungus peculiar to the locality and designated from its habitat
<i>Mucor stalactitis</i>. The Toy-Shop is an amusing collection of these
freaks of nature.</p>
</div>

<p>The dimensions of the various chambers included in Luray
Cavern cannot easily be stated, on account of the great irregularity
of their outlines. Their size may be seen from the diagram.
But it should be understood that there are several tiers of
galleries, and the vertical depth from the highest to the lowest
is 260 ft. The large tract of land owned by the Luray Caverns
Corporations covers all possible modes of entrance.</p>

<p>The waters of this cavern appear to be entirely destitute of life;
and the existing fauna comprises only a few bats, rats, mice,
spiders, flies and small centipedes. When the cave was first
entered, the floor was covered with thousands of tracks of
raccoons, wolves and bears&mdash;most of them probably made
long ago, as impressions made in the tenacious clay that composes
most of the cavern floor would remain unchanged for
centuries. Layers of excrementitious matter appear, and also
many small bones, along with a few large ones, all of existing
species. The traces of human occupation are pieces of charcoal,
flints, moccasin tracks and a single skeleton embedded in stalagmite
in one of the chasms, estimated, from the present rate of
stalagmitic growth, to have lain where found for not more than
five hundred years.</p>

<p>The temperature is uniformly 54° Fahr., coinciding with that
of Mammoth Cave, Kentucky. The air is very pure, and the
avenues are not uncomfortably damp. The portions open to the
public are now lighted by electric lamps. The registered number
of visitors in 1906 was 18,000. A unique and highly successful
experiment merits mention, by which the cool pure air of Luray
Cavern is forced through all the rooms of the Limair sanatorium
erected in 1901, by Mr T. C. Northcott, president of the Luray
Caverns Corporation, on the summit of Cave Hill. Tests made
for several successive years by means of culture media and sterile
plates, demonstrated the perfect bacteriologic purity of the air,
first drawn into the caverns through myriads of rocky crevices
that served as natural filters, then further cleansed by floating
over the transparent springs and pools, and finally supplied
to the inmates of the sanatorium.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LURCH,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> a word with several meanings, the etymological
relationships of which are obscure. The chief uses which survive
are&mdash;(1) in the phrase &ldquo;to leave in the lurch,&rdquo; to abandon
some one, to leave him in a position of great difficulty; (2) a
stagger, sudden leaning over, originally a nautical expression
of a sudden &ldquo;list&rdquo; made by a ship; (3) the name of a dog, the
&ldquo;lurcher&rdquo; used by poachers, properly a cross between a sheepdog
or collie and a greyhound. In (1) &ldquo;lurch&rdquo; is the name of
a game, of which nothing is known (it is supposed to have
resembled backgammon), and also of a state of the score in various
games, in which the loser either scores nothing or is beaten by
very heavy points. In this sense the term is practically obsolete.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span>
It was taken from Fr. <i>lourche</i>, connected with many German
forms, now only dialectical such as <i>Lortsch</i>, <i>Lurtsch</i>, <i>Lorz</i>, <i>Lurz</i>,
all for some kind of game, but also meaning left-hand, wrong,
which the <i>New English Dictionary</i> thinks is the origin of the
word, it being first used as a term in gambling. In (2) &ldquo;lurch&rdquo;
occurs first in the form &ldquo;lee-lurches,&rdquo; sudden rolls a ship takes
to leeward in a heavy sea, which may be a corruption of &ldquo;lee-latch,&rdquo;
defined in Smyth&rsquo;s <i>Sailor&rsquo;s Word Book</i> as dropping to leeward
of the course. In (3) &ldquo;lurch&rdquo; is probably another form
of &ldquo;lurk,&rdquo; to lie in wait for, watch stealthily, hence to pilfer, steal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LURGAN,<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> a market-town of Co. Armagh, Ireland, well
situated on high ground overlooking Lough Neagh a few miles
to the north; 20 m. S.W. of Belfast by the Great Northern
railway. Pop. (1901) 11,782. The parish church of Shankill
(this parish including Lurgan) has a finely proportioned tower.
Contiguous to the town is Lurgan Castle, a fine modern Elizabethan
structure, the seat of Lord Lurgan. Lurgan is famed for
its diapers, and the linen trade is of the first importance, but
there are also tobacco factories and coach factories. It is
governed by an urban district council. Lurgan was founded by
William Brownlow, to whom a grant of the town was made by
James I. In 1619 it consisted of forty-two houses, all inhabited
by English settlers. It was burned by the insurgents in 1641,
and again by the troops of James II. After its restoration in
1690 a patent for a market and fair was obtained.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LURIA, ISAAC BEN SOLOMON<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> (1534-1572), Jewish mystic,
was born in Jerusalem. From his German descent he was surnamed
<i>Ashkenazi</i> (the German), and we find that epithet applied
to him in a recently discovered document of date 1559. In
that year Isaac Luria was living in Cairo and trading as a spice
merchant with his headquarters in Alexandria. He had come
to Egypt as a boy after his father&rsquo;s death, and was brought up
by his wealthy maternal uncle Mordecai Francis. The boy,
according to the legends which soon grew round his life, was a
&ldquo;wonder-child,&rdquo; and early displayed marvellous capacity.
He married as a lad of fifteen, his bride being his cousin. For
some time he continued his studies; later on when engaged
in business there was no break in this respect. Two years after
his marriage he became possessed of a copy of the Kabbalistic
&ldquo;Bible&rdquo;&mdash;the <i>Zohar</i> of Moses de Leon (<i>q.v.</i>). In order to
meditate on the mystic lore he withdrew to a hut by the Nile,
returning home for the Sabbath. Luria afterwards gave to the
Sabbath a mystic beauty such as it had never before possessed.
Thus passed several years; he was still young, but his new mode
of life produced its effects on a man of his imagination and
saintly piety. He became a visionary. Elijah, who had been his
godfather in his babyhood, now paid him frequent visits, initiating
him into sublime truths. By night Luria&rsquo;s soul ascended to
heaven and conversed with celestial teachers who had once been
men of renown on earth.</p>

<p>In 1566 at earliest Luria removed to Safed. This Palestinian
town was in the 16th century the headquarters of the Kabbala.
A large circle of Talmudists lived there; at their head Joseph
Qaro, then over eighty years of age. Qaro&rsquo;s son married Luria&rsquo;s
daughter, and Qaro rejoiced at the connexion, for he had a high
opinion of Luria&rsquo;s learning. Mysticism is often the expression of
a revolt against authority, but in Luria&rsquo;s case mysticism was
not divorced from respect for tradition. After his arrival at
Safed Luria lived at most six years, and died in 1572. But these
years were momentous for Judaism. He established an extraordinary
reputation; his personality had a winning attractiveness;
and he founded a school of mystics who powerfully affected
Judaism after the master&rsquo;s death. The Holy Spirit, we are told,
rested on him, drawn to him by the usual means of the mystics&mdash;self-flogging,
ablutions and penance. He had wonderful gifts
of insight, and spoke to the birds. Miracles abounded. More
soberly true is the statement that he went on long walks with
enthusiastic disciples, whom he taught without books. Luria
himself wrote no mystical works; what we know of his doctrines
and habits comes chiefly from his Boswell, Hayim Vital.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There was little of originality in Luria&rsquo;s doctrines; the theory of
emanations, the double belief in the process of the Divine Essence
as it were self-concentrating (<i>Zimzum</i>) and on the other hand as
expanding throughout creation; the philosophical &ldquo;sceptism&rdquo;
which regards God as unknowable but capable of direct intuition
by feeling&mdash;these were all common elements of mystical thought.
Luria was an inspirer of saintly conduct rather than an innovator
in theories. Not beliefs, he said, but believers need rebirth. As he
rose in the morning he prayed: &ldquo;O God, grant that throughout this
coming day I may be able to love my neighbour as myself.&rdquo; Never
would he retire to rest until he had fulfilled his definite engagements
to those who had served him. Luria and his school altered the very
look of the Jewish Prayer Book. Prayer was his main prop. By it
men became controllers of the earthly world and reached God.
He or his school introduced innumerable ritual customs, some of
them beautiful enough. On Sabbath he dressed in white, wearing
a four-fold garment to typify the four letters of the Divine Name.
The Sabbath was to him an actual cult. It was a day of the most
holy joy. Resuming the Talmudic idea of an Over-soul present in
every Israelite on the Sabbath, Luria and his school made play with
this Over-soul, fed it with spiritual and material dainties and evolved
an intricate maze of mystic ceremonial, still observed by countless
masses. Another strong point with Luria was penance. The confessions
of sin which he introduced descend to minute ritual details
and rise to the most exalted aspects of social and spiritual life.
He deprecated general confessions and demanded that the individual
must lay bare the recesses of his heart. Hayim Vital reports that
on his death-bed Luria said to his disciples: &ldquo;Be at peace with one
another: bear with one another: and so be worthy of my coming
again to reveal to you what no mortal ear has heard before.&rdquo; His
mystic ceremonial became a guide to religious practice, and though
with this there came in much meaningless and even bewildering
formalism, yet the example of his life and character was a lasting
inspiration to saintliness.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LURISTAN,<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> in the wider sense (as its name implies) the &ldquo;Land
of the Lurs,&rdquo; namely that part of western Persia which is bounded
by Turkish territory on the west and extends for about 400 m.
N.W.-S.E. from Kermanshah to Fars with a breadth of 100 to
140 m. It is chiefly mountainous, being intersected by numerous
ranges running N.W.-S.E. The central range has many summits
which are almost within the line of perpetual snow, rising to
13,000 ft. and more, and in it are the sources of Persia&rsquo;s most
important rivers, as the Zayendeh-rud, Jarahi, Karun, Diz, Abi,
Kerkheh. Between the higher ranges are many fertile plains and
low hilly districts, well watered but comparatively little cultivated
in consequence of intertribal feuds. The Lurs are thought to
be aboriginal Persians with a mixture of Semitic blood. Their
language is a dialect of Persian and does not differ materially
from Kurdish. Outwardly they are Mussulmans of the Shiah
branch, but most of them show little veneration for either
Prophet or Koran, and the religion of some of them seems to be
a mixture of Ali-Illahism involving a belief in successive incarnations
combined with mysterious, ancient, heathen rites. The
northern part of Luristan, which was formerly known as Lurikuchik
(little Luristan), is inhabited by the Feili Lurs and these
are divided into the Pishkuh (cis-montane) Lurs in the east and
Pushtkuh (ultra-montane) Lurs in the west adjoining Turkish
territory. They number about 350,000. Little Luristan was
governed by a race of independent princes of the Khurshidi
dynasty, and called atabegs, from 1155 to the beginning of the
17th century when the last atabeg, Shah Verdi Khan, was removed
by Shah Abbas I. and the government of the province
given to Husain Khan, the chief of a rival tribe, with the title
of vali in exchange for that of atabeg. The descendants of
Husain Khan have retained the title but now govern only the
Pushtkuh Lurs, to whom only the denomination of Feili is at
present applied. The southern part of Luristan was formerly
known as Lur i Buzurg (great Luristan) and is composed of the
Bakhtiari division of the Arabistan province and the districts of
the Mamasennis and Kuhgilus which belong to Fars. The
Bakhtiaris number about 200,000, the others 40,000. Great
Luristan was an independent state under the Fazlevieh
atabegs from 1160 until 1424, and its capital was Idaj, now
represented by mounds and ruins at Malamir 60 m. S.E. of
Shushter.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUSATIA<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> (Ger. <i>Lausitz</i>), a name applied to two neighbouring
districts in Germany, Upper and Lower Lusatia, belonging now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>130</span>
mainly to Prussia, but partly to Saxony. The name is taken
from the Lusitzi, a Slav tribe, who inhabited Lower Lusatia in
the 9th and 10th centuries.</p>

<p>In the earliest times Lower Lusatia reached from the Black
Elster to the Spree; its inhabitants, the Lusitzi, were conquered
by the German king, Henry the Fowler, and by the margrave
Gero in the 10th century. Their land was formed into a separate
march, which for about three centuries was sometimes attached
to, and sometimes independent of, the margraviate of Meissen,
its rulers being occasionally called margraves of Lusatia. In 1303
it was purchased by the margrave of Brandenburg, and after
other changes it fell in 1368 into the hands of the king of Bohemia,
the emperor Charles IV., who already possessed Upper Lusatia.
During the Hussite wars its people remained loyal to the Roman
Catholic Church. In 1469 they recognized Matthias Corvinus,
king of Hungary, as their sovereign, but in 1490 they came again
under the rule of the Bohemian king.</p>

<p>The district now known as Upper Lusatia was occupied by a
Slav tribe, the Milzeni, who like the Lusitzi, were subdued by
Henry the Fowler early in the 10th century. For about three
centuries it was called Baudissin (Bautzen), from the name of its
principal fortress. In the 11th and 12th centuries it was connected
at different periods with Meissen, Poland and Bohemia. Towards
1160 the emperor Frederick I. granted it to Ladislas, king
of Bohemia, and under this ruler and his immediate successors
it was largely colonized by German immigrants. In 1253 it
passed to the margrave of Brandenburg, and about the same
time it was divided into an eastern and a western part, Baudissin
proper and Görlitz. In 1319 the former was restored to Bohemia,
which also recovered Görlitz in 1329. During the 14th century
the nobles and the townsmen began to take part in the government,
and about this time Upper Lusatia was known as the
district of the six towns (<i>Sechsstädtelandes</i>), these being Bautzen,
Görlitz, Zittau, Löbau, Lauban and Kamenz. From 1377 to
1396 Görlitz was a separate duchy ruled by John, a son of the
emperor Charles IV., and, like Lower Lusatia, Upper Lusatia
owned the authority of Matthias Corvinus from 1469 to 1490,
both districts passing a little later with the kingdoms of Hungary
and Bohemia to the German king, Ferdinand I. The &ldquo;six
towns&rdquo; were severely punished for their share in the war of the
league of Schmalkalden, and about this time the reformed teaching
made very rapid progress in Lusatia, the majority of the
inhabitants becoming Protestants. The name of Lusatia
hitherto confined to Lower Lusatia, was soon applied to both
districts, the adjectives Upper and Lower being used to distinguish
them. In 1620, early in the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, the two
Lusatias were conquered by the elector of Saxony, John George I.,
who was allowed to keep them as the price of his assistance to the
emperor Ferdinand I. In 1635 by the treaty of Prague they were
definitely transferred from Bohemia to Saxony, although the
emperor as king of Bohemia retained a certain supremacy for
the purpose of guarding the rights and privileges of the Roman
Catholics. They suffered much during the wars of the 18th
century. By the peace of Vienna (1815) the whole of Lower
Lusatia and part of Upper Lusatia were transferred from Saxony
to Prussia.</p>

<p>The area of the part of Upper Lusatia retained by Saxony was
slightly increased in 1845; it is now about 960 sq. m. In 1900
Lower Lusatia contained 461,973 inhabitants, of whom 34,837
were Wends; the portion of Upper Lusatia belonging to Prussia
had 305,080 inhabitants, of whom 24,361 were Wends. There
were 405,173 inhabitants, including 28,234 Wends, in Saxon
Upper Lusatia. Laws relating to this district, after passing
through the Saxon parliament must be submitted to the Lusatian
diet at Bautzen. The chief towns of Upper Lusatia are Bautzen,
Zittau, Löbau, Kamenz, Görlitz, Rothenburg, Hoyerswerda and
Lauban; in Lower Lusatia they are Guben, Kottbus, Forst,
Lubben and Spremberg. The principal rivers are the Spree with
its tributaries, the Black Elster and the Neisse. Upper Lusatia
is generally mountainous and picturesque, Lower Lusatia is
flat and sandy. The chief industries are linen weaving, cloth
making and coal mining.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUSHAI HILLS,<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> a mountainous district of Eastern Bengal
and Assam, south of Cachar, on the border between Assam and
Burma. Area, 7227 sq. m.; pop. (1901) 82,434. The hills are
for the most part covered with dense bamboo jungle and rank
undergrowth; but in the eastern portion, owing probably to a
smaller rainfall, open grass-covered slopes are found, with groves
of oak and pine interspersed with rhododendrons. These hills
are inhabited by the Lushais and cognate tribes, but the population
is extremely scanty. From the earliest known times the
original inhabitants were Kukis, and the Lushais were not heard
of until 1840, when they invaded the district from the north.
Their first attack upon British territory took place in November
1849, and after that date they proved one of the most troublesome
tribes on the north-east frontier of India; but operations in 1890
resulted in the complete pacification of the northern Lushai
villages, and in 1892 the eastern Lushais were reduced to order.
The management of the South Lushai hill country was transferred
from Bengal to Assam in 1898. To obtain more efficient control
over the country the district has been divided into eighteen
circles, each in charge of an interpreter, through whom all orders
are transmitted to the chiefs. The Welsh Presbyterian Mission
began work at Aijal in 1897, and the people have shown unexpected
readiness to accept education. According to the
census of 1901 the total number of Lushais in Assam was 63,452.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUSIGNAN,<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> the name of a family which sprang from Poitou<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
and distinguished itself by its connexion with the kingdom of
Jerusalem, and still more by its long tenure of the kingdom of
Cyprus (1192-1475). A Hugh de Lusignan appears in the ill-fated
crusade of 1100-1101; another Hugh, the Brown, came
as a pilgrim to the Holy Land in 1164, and was taken prisoner
by Nureddin. In the last quarter of the 12th century the two
brothers Amalric and Guy, sons of Hugh the Brown, played a
considerable part in the history of the Latin East. About 1180
Amalric was constable of the kingdom of Jerusalem; and he
is said to have brought his handsome brother Guy to the notice
of Sibylla, the widowed heiress of the kingdom. Guy and
Sibylla were married in 1180; and Guy thus became heir presumptive
of the kingdom, if the young Baldwin V., Sibylla&rsquo;s
son by her first marriage to William of Montferrat, should die
without issue. He acted as regent in 1183, but he showed some
incapacity in the struggle with Saladin, and was deprived of all
right of succession. In 1186, however, on the death of Baldwin
V., he succeeded in obtaining the crown, in spite of the opposition
of Raymund of Tripoli. Next year he suffered a crushing
defeat at the battle of Hittin, and was taken prisoner by Saladin.
Released on parole in 1188, he at once broke his parole, and
began the siege of Acre. Difficulties, however, had arisen with
Conrad of Montferrat; and when Guy lost his wife Sibylla in
1190, and Conrad married Isabella, her sister, now heiress of
the kingdom, these difficulties culminated in Conrad&rsquo;s laying
claim to the crown. Guy found his cause espoused in 1191 by
the overlord of his house, Richard I. of England; but Conrad&rsquo;s
superior ability, and the support of the French crusaders, ultimately
carried the day, and in 1192 Richard himself abandoned
the pretensions of Guy, and recognized Conrad as king. Though
Conrad was almost immediately assassinated, the crown did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>131</span>
return to Guy, but went to Henry of Champagne, who married
the widowed Isabella. Guy found some satisfaction for his loss
in buying from the Templars the island of Cyprus, and there he
reigned for the last two years of his life (1192-1194). He is
judged harshly by contemporary writers, as <i>simplex</i> and <i>insufficiens</i>;
but Dodu (in his <i>Histoire des institutions du royaume
de Jérusalem</i>) suggests that Guy was depreciated because the
kingdom had been lost in his reign, in much the same way as
Godfrey of Bouillon was exalted because Jerusalem had just been
won at his accession. Guy was a brave if not a particularly
able knight; and his instant attack on Acre after his release by
Saladin shows that he had the <i>sentiment de ses devoirs</i>.</p>

<p>He was succeeded in Cyprus by his brother Amalric, who
acquired the title of king of Cyprus from the emperor Henry VI.,
and became king of Jerusalem in 1197 by his marriage to Isabella,
after the death of Henry of Champagne (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Amalric II.</a></span>).
Amalric was the founder of a dynasty of kings of Cyprus, which
lasted till 1475, while after 1269 his descendants regularly
enjoyed the title of kings of Jerusalem. The scions of the house
of Lusignan proved themselves the most sincere of crusaders.
They possessed in Cyprus a kingdom, in which they had vindicated
for themselves a stronger hold over their feudatories than
the kings of Jerusalem had ever enjoyed, and in which trading
centres like Famagusta flourished vigorously; and they used
the resources of their kingdom, in conjunction with the Hospitallers
of Rhodes, to check the progress of the Mahommedans.</p>

<p>Among the most famous members of the house who ruled in
Cyprus three may be mentioned. The first is Hugh III. (the
Great), who was king from 1267 to 1285: to him, apparently,
St Thomas dedicated his <i>De Regimine Principum</i>; and it is in
his reign that the kingdom of Jerusalem becomes permanently
connected with that of Cyprus. The second is Hugh IV. (1324-1359),
to whom Boccaccio dedicated one of his works, and who
set on foot an alliance with the pope, Venice and the Hospitallers,
which resulted in the capture of Smyrna (1344). The
last is Peter I., Hugh&rsquo;s second son and successor, who reigned
from 1359 to 1369, when he was assassinated as the result of a
conspiracy of the barons. Peter and his chancellor de Mezières
represent the last flicker of the crusading spirit (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Crusades</a></span>).</p>

<p>Before the extinction of the line in 1475, it had succeeded in
putting a branch on the throne of Armenia. Five short-lived
kings of the house ruled in Armenia after 1342, &ldquo;Latin exiles,&rdquo;
as Stubbs says, &ldquo;in the midst of several strange populations
all alike hostile.&rdquo; The kingdom of Armenia fell before the
sultan of Egypt, who took prisoner its last king Leo V. in 1375,
though the kings of Cyprus afterwards continued to bear the
title; the kingdom of Cyprus itself continued to exist under
the house of Lusignan for 100 years longer. The mother of the
last king, James III. (who died when he was two years old),
was a Venetian lady, Catarina Cornaro. She had been made a
daughter of the republic at the time of her marriage to the king
of Cyprus; and on the death of her child the republic first acted
as guardian for its daughter, and then, in 1489, obtained from
her the cession of the island.</p>

wife, Isabella of Angoulême, King John of England seized (thus
bringing upon himself the loss of the greater part of his French
possessions), was a nephew of Guy of Lusignan. He ultimately

<p><span class="bold">LUSTRATION,<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> a term that includes all the methods of purification
and expiation among the Greeks and Romans. Among
the Greeks there are two ideas clearly distinguishable&mdash;that
human nature must purify itself (<span class="grk" title="katharsis">&#954;&#940;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>) from guilt before
it is fit to enter into communion with God or even to associate
with men, and that guilt must be expiated voluntarily (<span class="grk" title="hilasmos">&#7985;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>)
by certain processes which God has revealed, in order to avoid
the punishment that must otherwise overtake it. It is not
possible to make such a distinction among the Latin terms
<i>lustratio</i>, <i>piacula</i>, <i>piamenta</i>, <i>caerimoniae</i>, and even among the
Greeks it is not consistently observed. Guilt and impurity
arose in various ways; among the Greeks, besides the general
idea that man is always in need of purification, the species of
guilt most insisted on by religion are incurred by murder, by
touching a dead body, by sexual intercourse, and by seeing a
prodigy or sign of the divine will. The last three spring from
the idea that man had been without preparation and improperly
brought into communication with God, and was therefore guilty.
The first, which involves a really moral idea of guilt, is far more
important than the others in Hellenic religion. Among the
Romans we hear more of the last species of impurity; in general
the idea takes the form that after some great disaster the people
become convinced that guilt has been incurred and must be
expiated. The methods of purification consist in ceremonies
performed with water, fire, air or earth, or with a branch of a
sacred tree, especially of the laurel, and also in sacrifice and
other ceremonial. Before entering a temple the worshipper
dipped his hand in the vase of holy water (<span class="grk" title="perirrhantêrion">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#8164;&#8165;&#945;&#957;&#942;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>, <i>aqua
lustralis</i>) which stood at the door; before a sacrifice bathing
was common; salt-water was more efficacious than fresh, and
the celebrants of the Eleusinian mysteries bathed in the sea
(<span class="grk" title="halade, mystai">&#7940;&#955;&#945;&#948;&#949;, &#956;&#973;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>); the water was more efficacious if a firebrand
from the altar were plunged in it. The torch, fire and sulphur
(<span class="grk" title="to theion">&#964;&#8056; &#952;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span>) were also powerful purifying agents. Purification by
air was most frequent in the Dionysiac mysteries; puppets
suspended and swinging in the air (<i>oscilla</i>) formed one way of
using the lustrative power of the air. Rubbing with sand and
salt was another method. The sacrifice chiefly used for purification
by the Greeks was a pig; among the Romans it was always,
except in the Lupercalia, a pig, a sheep and a bull (<i>suovetaurilia</i>).
In Athens a purificatory sacrifice and prayer was held before
every meeting of the ecclesia; the Maimacteria,<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> in honour of
Zeus Maimactes (the god of wrath), was an annual festival of
purification, and at the Thargelia two men (or a woman and a
man) were sacrificed on the seashore, their bodies burned and
the ashes thrown into the sea, to avert the wrath of Apollo. On
extraordinary occasions lustrations were performed for a whole
city. So Athens was purified by Epimenides after the Cylonian
massacre, and Delos in the Peloponnesian War (426 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) to stop
the plague and appease the wrath of Apollo. In Rome, besides
such annual ceremonies as the <i>Ambarvalia</i>, <i>Lupercalia</i>, <i>Cerialia</i>,
<i>Paganalia</i>, &amp;c., there was a lustration of the fleet before it sailed,
and of the army before it marched. Part of the ceremonial
always consisted in leading or carrying the victims round the
impure persons or things. After any disaster the <i>lustratio
classium</i> or <i>exercitus</i> was often again performed, so as to make
certain that the gods got all their due. The <i>Amburbium</i>, a
solemn procession of the people round the boundaries of Rome,
was a similar ceremonial performed for the whole city on
occasions of great danger or calamity; the <i>Ambilustrium</i> (so
called from the sacrificial victims being carried round the people
assembled on the Campus Martius) was the purificatory ceremony
which took place after the regular quinquennial census (<i>lustrum</i>)
of the Roman people.</p>

Span. <i>laud</i>; Ger. <i>Laute</i>; Dut. <i>luit</i>), an ancient stringed
musical instrument, derived in form as well as name from the
Arabs. The complete family consisted of the pandura, tanbur
or mandoline as treble, the lute as alto or tenor, the barbiton or
theorbo as bass, and the chitarrone as double bass. The Arab
instrument, with convex sound-body, pointing to the resonance
board or membrane having been originally placed upon a gourd,
was strung with silk and played with a plectrum of shell or quill.
It was adopted by the Arabs from Persia. Instruments with
vaulted backs are all undoubtedly of Eastern origin; the
distinct type, resembling the longitudinal section of a pear, is
more specially traced in ancient India, Persia and the countries
influenced by their civilization. This type of instrument includes
many families which became known during the middle
ages of western Europe, being introduced into southern Europe
and Spain by the Moors, into southern Russia by the Persians
of the Sassanian period, into Greece from the confines of the
Byzantine Empire. As long as the strings were plucked by
fingers or plectrum the large pear-shaped instrument may be
identified as the archetype of the lute. When the bow, obtained
from Persia, was applied to the instrument by the Arabs, a fresh
family was formed, which was afterwards known in Europe
as rebab and later rebec. The largest member of the ancient
lute family&mdash;the bass lute or theorbo&mdash;has been identified with
the barbiton.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Until recently the existence of these ancient stringed instruments
was presumed on the evidence of the early medieval European instruments
and of the meagre writings extant, such as those of F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;.<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
But a chain of plastic evidence can now be offered, beginning with
the Greek post-Mycenaean age (<i>c.</i> 1000 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). A statuette of a female
musician playing upon a large lute with only an embryonic neck, on
which nevertheless the left hand is
stopping strings, was unearthed in
Egypt in a tomb of the XXth Dynasty
in the cemetery of Goshen by the
members of the British School of
Archaeology in Egypt,<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> under the
direction of Professor Flinders Petrie,
to whose courtesy we owe the photograph
(fig. 1) here reproduced. It is
difficult to form a conclusive opinion
as to the number of strings the artist
intended to represent, owing to the
decorative figures following the direction
of the strings, but, judging from
the position of the right hand plucking
a string, there may have been seven.
Among a number of terra-cotta figures
of musicians, brought to light during
the excavations in a Tell at Suza and
dating from the 8th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,<a name="fa3c" id="fa3c" href="#ft3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
although there is no instrument that
might be identified with the alto lute,
the treble lute or tanbur is represented
with a long, curved neck and a head
bent back to increase the tension, and
there is also an instrument having a
smaller and more elongated body than
the lute. On one of the friezes from
Afghanistan presented to the British
Museum by Major-General Cunningham, which formed the risers of
steps leading to the tope at Jumal Garhi, dating from the 1st century
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> are represented scenes of music and dancing. Here the archetype
of the lute appears several times; it had four strings, and
the head was bent back at right angles to the neck. In the 6th century
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> illustrations of this early lute are no longer rare, more
especially on Persian silver-work of the Sassanian period<a name="fa4c" id="fa4c" href="#ft4c"><span class="sp">4</span></a> and in
the paintings of the Buddhist cave-temples of Ajanta.<a name="fa5c" id="fa5c" href="#ft5c"><span class="sp">5</span></a> Several
representations of the barbiton are extant from the classical Roman
period.</p>

<p>The modern Egyptian &lsquo;&#363;d is the direct descendant of the Arabic
lute, and, according to Lane, is strung with seven pairs of catgut
strings played by a plectrum. A specimen in the Victoria and Albert
Museum, given by the khedive, has four pairs only, which appears
to have been the old stringing of the instrument. When frets (cross-lines
dividing the neck or finger-board to show the fingering) are
employed they are of catgut disposed according to the Arabic scale
of seventeen intervals in the octave, consisting of twelve limmas,
an interval rather less than our equal semitone, and five commas,
which are very small but quite recognizable differences of pitch.</p>

<p>The lute family is separated from the guitars, also of Eastern
origin, by the formation of the sound body, which is in all lutes
pear-shaped, without the sides or ribs necessary to the structure of
the flat-backed guitar and cither. Observing this distinction, we
include with the lute the little Neapolitan mandoline of 2 ft. long
and the large double-necked Roman chitarrone, not infrequently
6 ft. long. Mandolines are partly strung with wire, and are played
with a plectrum, indispensable for metal or short strings. Perhaps
the earliest lutes were so played, but the large lutes and theorbos
strung with catgut have been invariably touched by the fingers only,
the length permitting this more sympathetic means of producing the
tone.</p>

<p>Praetorius,<a name="fa6c" id="fa6c" href="#ft6c"><span class="sp">6</span></a> writing when the lute was in universal favour,
mentions seven varieties distinguished by size and tuning. The
smallest would be larger than a mandoline, and the melody
string, the &ldquo;chanterelle,&rdquo; often a single string, lower in pitch.
Praetorius calls this an octave lute, with the chanterelle C or D.
The two discant lutes have respectively B and A, the alto G, the
tenor E, the bass D, and the great octave bass G, an octave
below the alto lute which may be taken as the model lute cultivated
by the amateurs of the time. The bass lutes were theorbos,
that is, double-necked lutes, as described below. The accordance
of an alto lute was <img style="width:301px; height:56px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img132b.jpg" alt="" />
founded upon that of the original eight-stringed European lute, to
which the highest and lowest notes had, in course of time, been
added. A later addition was the <img style="width:86px; height:39px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img132c.jpg" alt="" /> also on the finger-board,
and bass strings, double or single, known as diapasons,
which, descending to the deep C of the violoncello, were not stopped
with the fingers. The diapasons were tuned as the key of the piece
of music required. Fig. 2 represents an Italian instrument made by
one of the most celebrated lute
makers, Venere of Padua, in 1600;
it is 3 ft. 6 in. high, and has six
pairs of unisons and eight single
diapasons. The finger-board,
divided into approximately equal
half tones by the frets, as a rule
eight in number, was often further
divided on the higher notes, for
ten, eleven, or, as in the woodcut,
even twelve, semitones. The head,
bearing the tuning pegs, was placed
at an obtuse or a right angle to the
neck, to increase the bearing of the
strings upon the nut, and be convenient
for sudden requirements of
tuning during performance, the
trouble of keeping a lute in tune
being proverbial.</p>

<p>The lute was in general use during
the 16th and 17th centuries. In the
18th it declined; still J. S. Bach
wrote a &ldquo;partita&rdquo; for it. The latest
date we have met with of an engraved
publication for the lute is
1760.</p>

<p>The large double-necked lute,
with two sets of tuning pegs, the
lower for the finger-board, the
higher for the diapason strings, was
known as the theorbo; also, and
especially in England, as the arch-lute;
and, in a special form, the neck being then very long, as
the chitarrone. Theorbo and chitarrone appear together at the
close of the 16th century, and their introduction was synchronous
with the rise of accompanied monody in music, that is, of the oratorio
and the opera. Peri, Caccini and Monteverde used theorbos to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>133</span>
accompany their newly-devised recitative, the invention of which
in Florence, from the impulse of the Renaissance, is well known.
The height of a theorbo varied from 3 ft. 6 in. to 5 ft., the Paduan
being always the largest, excepting the Roman 6-ft. long chitarrone.
These large lutes had very deep notes, and doubtless great liberties
were allowed in tuning, but the strings on the finger-board followed
the lute accordance already given, or another quoted by Baron
(<i>Untersuchung des Instruments der Lauten</i>, Nuremberg, 1727) as the
old theorbo or &ldquo;violway&rdquo; (see Mace, <i>Musick&rsquo;s Monument</i>, London,
1676):&mdash;</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:356px; height:55px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img133.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="noind">We find again both these accordances varied and transposed a tone
higher, perhaps with thinner strings, or to accommodate local differences
of pitch. Praetorius recommends the chanterelles of theorbos
being tuned an octave lower on account of the great strain. By such
a change, another authority, the Englishman Thomas Mace, says, the
life and spruceness of airy lessons were quite lost. The theorbo or
arch-lute had at last to give way to the violoncello and double bass,
which are still used to accompany the &ldquo;recitativo secco&rdquo; in oratorios
and operas. Handel wrote a part for a theorbo in <i>Esther</i> (1720);
after that date it appears no more in orchestral scores, but remained
in private use until nearly the end of the century.</p>

<p>The lute and the organ share the distinction of being the first
instruments for which the oldest instrumental compositions we
possess were written. For the lute, however, they were not written
in our present notation, but in tablature, &ldquo;lyrawise,&rdquo; a system by
which as many lines were drawn horizontally as there were pairs of
strings on the finger-board, the frets, distributed at intervals of a
semitone, being distinguished by the letters of the alphabet, repeated
from A, representing the open string, for each line. This was the
English and French manner; the Italian was by numbers instead of
letters. The signs of time were placed over the stave, and were not
repeated unless the mensural values changed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUTHARDT, CHRISTOPH ERNST<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span> (1823-1902), German
Lutheran theologian, was born at Maroldsweisach, Bavaria, on
the 22nd of March 1823. He studied theology at Erlangen and
Berlin, and in 1856 became professor ordinarius of systematic
theology and New Testament exegesis at Leipzig. In 1865 he
was made a counsellor to the consistory, in 1871 canon of
Meissen cathedral, and in 1887 a privy councillor to the church.
He died at Leipzig on the 21st of September 1902. A strictly
orthodox theologian, and a clear writer, though not a very
profound scholar, Luthardt became widely appreciated as the
author of apologetic lectures. These were collected under the
title <i>Apologie des Christentums</i> (vol. i., 1864, 14th ed. 1896;
vol. ii. 7th ed., 1901; vol. iii. 7th ed., 1898; vol. iv. 2nd ed.,
1880), a work of which the first three volumes have been translated
into English. In 1868 he founded and edited the <i>Allgemeine
evang.-lutherische Kirchenzeitung</i>, with its supplement the
<i>Theologisches Litteraturblatt</i>, and in 1880 became editor of the

<p><span class="bold">LUTHER, MARTIN<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> (1483-1546), the great German religious
reformer, was born at Eisleben on the 10th of November 1483.
His father, Hans Luther (Lyder, Luder, Ludher), a peasant from
the township of Möhra in Thuringia, after his marriage with
Margarethe Ziegler, had settled in Mansfeld, attracted by the
prospects of work in the mines there. The counts of Mansfeld,
who, many years before, had started the mining industry,
made a practice of building and letting out for hire small furnaces
for smelting the ore. Hans Luther soon leased one, then three.
In 1491 he became one of the four elected members of the village
council (<i>vier Herren von der Gemeinde</i>); and we are told that
the counts of Mansfeld held him in esteem. The boy grew up
amid the poor, coarse surroundings of the German peasant
life, imbibing its simple beliefs. He was taught that the Emperor
protected the poor people against the Turk, that the Church
was the &ldquo;Pope&rsquo;s House,&rdquo; wherein the Bishop of Rome had all
the rights of the house-father. He shared the common superstitions
of the time and some of them never left him.</p>

<p>Young Martin went to the village school at Mansfeld; to a
school at Magdeburg kept by the Brethren of the Common Lot;
then to the well-known St George&rsquo;s school at Eisenach. At
Magdeburg and Eisenach Luther was &ldquo;a poor student,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
a boy who was received into a hospice where he lived rent-free,
attended school without paying fees, and had the privilege of
begging for his bread at the house-doors of the town; in return
for which he sang as a chorister in the church to which the
school was attached. Luther was never a &ldquo;wandering student&rdquo;;
his parents were too careful of their child to permit him to
lead the life of wandering licence which marked these pests of
medieval German scholastic life. At Eisenach he attracted the
notice of the wife of a wealthy merchant of Eisenach, whom his
biographers usually identify as Frau Cotta.</p>

<p>After three happy years at Eisenach, Luther entered the
university of Erfurt (1501), then the most famous in Germany.
Hans Luther had been prospering, and was more than ever
resolved to make his son a lawyer. Young Luther entered his
name on the matriculation book in letters which can still be
read &ldquo;Martinus Ludher ex Mansfelt,&rdquo; a free student, no longer
embarrassed by great poverty. In Luther&rsquo;s time Erfurt was the
intellectual centre of Germany and its students were exposed
to a variety of influences which could not fail to stimulate young
men of mental ability.</p>

<p>Its theology was, of course, scholastic, but of what was then
called the modern type, the Scotist; its philosophy was the
nominalist system of William of Occam, whose great disciple,
Gabriel Biel (d. 1495), had been one of its most famous professors;
Nicholas de Lyra&rsquo;s (d. 1340) system of biblical interpretation
had been long taught there by a succession of able teachers;
Humanism had won an early entrance to the university; the
anti-clerical teaching of John of Wessel, who had himself taught
at Erfurt for fifteen years (1445-1460), had left its mark on
the place and was not forgotten. Hussite propagandists, even in
Luther&rsquo;s time, secretly visited the town and whispered among
the students their anti-clerical Christian socialism. Papal
legates to Germany seldom failed to visit the university and by
their magnificence bore witness to the majesty of the Roman
church.</p>

<p>A study of the scholastic philosophy was then the preliminary
training for a course of law, and Luther worked so hard at the
prescribed studies that he had little leisure, he said, for classical
learning. He attended none of the Humanist lectures, but he
read a good many of the Latin authors and also learned a little
Greek. He never was a member of the Humanist circle; he
was too much in earnest about religious questions and of too
practical a turn of mind. The young Humanists would have
gladly welcomed him into their select band. They dubbed him
the &ldquo;philosopher,&rdquo; the &ldquo;musician,&rdquo; recalled in after days his
fine social disposition, his skill in playing the lute, and his ready
power in debate. He took the various degrees in an unusually
brief time. He was bachelor in 1502 and master in 1505. His
father, proud of his son&rsquo;s steady application and success, sent
him the costly present of a <i>Corpus Juris</i>. He may have begun
to study law. Suddenly he plunged into the Erfurt Convent of
the Augustinian Eremites and after due noviciate became a monk.</p>

<p>The action was so unexpected that his contemporaries felt
bound to give all manner of explanations which have been
woven into accounts which are legendary. Nothing is known
about the cause of the sudden plunge but what Luther has
himself revealed. He has told us that he entered the monastery
because he doubted of himself, and that his action was sudden
because he knew that his father would have disapproved of his
intention.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;doubt&rdquo; has made historians think of intellectual
difficulties&mdash;of the &ldquo;theological scepticism&rdquo; taught by Occam
and Biel, of the disintegrating criticism of Humanism. But
there is no trace of any theological difficulties in Luther&rsquo;s mind
in the struggles which sent him into the convent and distracted
him there. He was driven to do what he did by the pressure
of a practical religious need, the desire to save his soul. The
fires of hell and the shades of purgatory, which are the constant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>134</span>
background of Dante&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paradiso,&rdquo; were present to Luther from
childhood.</p>

<p>Luther was the greatest religious genius which the 16th
century produced, and the roots of the movement in which he
was the central figure must be sought for in the popular religious
life of the last decades of the 15th and opening decades of the
16th centuries&mdash;a field which has been neglected by almost all
his biographers. When it is explored traces of at least five
different types of religious sentiment can be discovered. Pious
parents, whether among the burghers or peasants, seem to have
taught their children a simple evangelical faith. Martin Luther
and thousands of children like him were trained at home to know
the creed, the ten commandments, the Lord&rsquo;s prayer, and such
simple hymns as <i>Ein Kindelein so lobelich</i>, <i>Nun bitten wir den
Heiligen Geist</i> and <i>Crist ist erstanden</i>; and they were taught
to believe that God for Christ&rsquo;s sake freely pardons sin. They
learned that simple faith which Luther afterwards expounded
in his <i>Small Catechism</i> and called the <i>Kinderlehre</i>. When lads
trained like himself entered school and college they came in
contact with that religious revival which characterized the
last half of the 15th century. Fear seemed to brood over the
peoples of Western Europe. The plague devastated the badly
drained towns, new diseases spread death, the fear of the Turks
was permanent. All this went to feed revival, which, founded
on fear, refused to see in Jesus Christ anything but a stern judge,
and made the Virgin Mother and Anna the &ldquo;grandmother&rdquo;
the intercessors; which found consolation in pilgrimages from
shrine to shrine; which believed in crude miracles, and in the
thought that God could be best served within convent walls.
Luther&rsquo;s mind was caught in this current of feeling. He records
how it was burnt into him by pictures which filled his boyish
imagination. Jesus in the painted window of Mansfeld church,
stern of face, sword in hand, sitting on a rainbow, coming to
judge; an altar-piece at Magdeburg, in which a ship with its
crew was sailing on to heaven, carrying no layman on board;
the deeds of St Elizabeth emblazoned on the window of St
George&rsquo;s parish church at Eisenach; the living pictures of a
young nobleman who had turned monk to save his soul, of a
monk, the holiest man Luther had ever known, who was aged
far beyond his years by his maceration; and many others of the
same kind.</p>

<p>Alongside this we can trace the growth of another religious
movement of a different kind. We can see a sturdy common-sense
religion taking possession of multitudes in Germany, which
insisted that laymen might rule in many departments supposed
to belong exclusively to the clergy. The <i>jus episcopale</i> which
Luther afterwards claimed for the secular authorities had been
practically exercised in Saxony and Brandenburg; cities and
districts had framed police regulations which set aside ecclesiastical
decrees about holidays and begging; the supervision of
charity was passing from the hands of the church into those of
laymen; and religious confraternities which did not take their
guidance from the clergy were increasing. Lastly, the medieval
Brethren were engaged in printing and distributing tracts,
mystical, anti-clerical, sometimes socialist. All these influences
abounded as Luther was growing to manhood and laid their
marks upon him. It was the momentary power of the second
which drove him into the convent, and he selected the monastic
order which represented all that was best in the revival
of the latter half of the 15th century&mdash;the Augustinian
Eremites.</p>

<p>In the convent Luther set himself to find salvation. The last
word of that Scotist theology which ruled at the close of the
middle ages was that man must work out his own salvation, and
Luther tried to do so in the most approved later medieval fashion
by the strictest asceticism. He fasted and scourged himself; he
practised all the ordinary forms of maceration and invented
new ones, all to no purpose. His theological studies, part of the
convent education, told him that pardon could be had through
the Sacrament of Penance, and that the first part of the sacrament
was sorrow for sin. The older theology declared that such
sorrow must be based on love to God. Had he this love? God
always appeared to him as an implacable judge, threatening
punishment for breaking a law which it was impossible to keep.
He confessed to himself that he often hated this arbitrary Will
which Scotist theology called God. The later theology, taught
in the convent by John of Palz and John Nathin, said that
sorrow might be based on a meaner motive provided the Sacrament
of Penance was continually resorted to. Luther wearied
his superiors with his attendance at the confessional. He was
looked upon as a young saint, and his reputation extended
throughout the convents of his order. The young saint felt
himself to be no nearer the pardon of God; he thought that he
was &ldquo;gallows-ripe.&rdquo; At last his superiors seemed to discover his
real difficulties. Partly by their help, partly by study of the
scriptures, he came to understand that God&rsquo;s pardon was to be
won by trusting to His promises. Thus after two years of indescribable
mental conflicts Luther found peace. The struggle
marked him for life. His victory gave him a sense of freedom,
and the feeling that life was given by God to be enjoyed. In all
external things he remained unchanged. He was a faithful son
of the medieval church, with its doctrines, ceremonies and
usages.</p>

<p>Soon after he had attained inward peace, Luther was ordained.
He continued his studies in theology, devoting himself to the
more &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; portions of Augustine, Bernard and
Gerson. He showed himself a good man of business and was
advanced in his order. In 1508 he was sent with some other
monks to Wittenberg to assist the small university which had
been opened there in 1502 by Frederick the Wise, elector of
Saxony. It was there that Luther began to preach, first in a
small chapel to the monks of his order; later taking the place
of one of the town&rsquo;s clergy who was in ill-health. From Wittenberg
he was sent by the chiefs of the German Augustinian
Eremites to Rome on a mission concerning the organization of
the order. He went up with the feelings of the medieval pilgrim
rather than with the intoxication of the ardent Humanist. On
his return (1512) he was sent by Staupitz, his vicar-general,
to Erfurt to take the necessary steps for higher graduation in
theology, in order to succeed Staupitz himself as professor of
theology in Wittenberg. He graduated as Doctor of the Holy
Scripture, took the Wittenberg doctor&rsquo;s oath to defend the
evangelical truth vigorously (<i>viriliter</i>), became a member of the
Wittenberg Senate, and three weeks later succeeded Staupitz
as professor of theology.</p>

<p>From the first Luther&rsquo;s lectures in theology differed from
those ordinarily given at the time. He had no opinions on
theological subjects at variance with the theology taught at
Erfurt and elsewhere. No one attributed any heretical views
to the young Wittenberg professor. He differed from others
because he looked at theology in a more practical way. He
thought it ought to be made useful to guide men to the grace of
God and to tell them how to persevere in a life of joyous obedience
to God and His commandments. His teaching was &ldquo;experimental&rdquo;
from the beginning. Besides he believed that he had
been specially set apart to lecture on the Holy Scriptures, and
he began by commenting on the Psalms and on the Epistles of
St Paul. He never knew much Hebrew and was not specially
strong in Greek; so he used the Vulgate in his prelections. He
had a huge widely printed volume on his desk, and wrote the
notes for his lectures on the margins and between the lines.
Some of the pages survive. They contain in the germ the leading
thoughts of what became Lutheran theology. At first he expressed
himself in the phrases common to scholastic theology,
when these were found to be inadequate in words borrowed from
the mystical writers of the 14th and 15th centuries, and then in
new phrases more appropriate to the circle of fresh thoughts.
Those new thoughts at first simply pushed aside the ordinary
theology taught in the schools without staying to criticize it.
Gradually, however, Luther began to find that there was some
real opposition between what he was teaching and the theology
he had been taught in the Erfurt convent. It appeared characteristically
enough on the practical and not on the speculative
side of theology in a sermon on <i>Indulgences</i> preached in July 1516.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>135</span>
Once begun the breach widened, until Luther could contrast
&ldquo;our theology&rdquo; with what was taught at Erfurt, and by September
he began to write against the scholastic theology, to
declare that it was Pelagian at heart, that it repudiated the
Augustinian doctrines of grace, and neglected to teach the
supreme value of that faith &ldquo;which throws itself upon God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These lectures and the teaching they contained soon made
a great impression. Students began to flock to the small obscure
university of Wittenberg, and the elector grew proud of the
teacher who was making his university famous. It was at this
interesting stage of his own religious career that he felt himself
compelled to stand forth in opposition to what he believed to
be a great religious scandal, and almost unconsciously to become
a Reformer.</p>

<p>Luther began his work as a Reformer by proposing to discuss
the true meaning of Indulgences. The occasion was an Indulgence
proclaimed by Pope Leo X., farmed by the archbishop
of Mainz, and preached by John Tetzel, a Dominican monk and
a famed seller of Indulgences. Many of the German princes
had no great love for Indulgence sellers, and Frederick of Saxony
had prohibited Tetzel from entering his territories. But it was
easy to reach most parts of Electoral Saxony without actually
crossing the frontiers. The Red Cross of the Indulgence seller
had been set up at Zerbst and at Jüterbogk, and people had gone
from Wittenberg to buy the <i>Papal Tickets</i>. Luther believed
that the sales were injurious to the morals of the townsmen; he
had heard reports of Tetzel&rsquo;s sermons; he had become wrathful
on reading the letter of recommendation of the archbishop;
and friends had urged him to interfere. He protested with a
characteristic combination of caution and courage. The church
of All Saints (the castle church) was closely connected with the
university of Wittenberg. Its doors were commonly used for
university proclamations. The Elector Frederick was a great
collector of relics and had stored them in his church. He had
procured an Indulgence for all who attended its services on
All Saints&rsquo; Day, and crowds commonly gathered. Luther
nailed ninety-five <i>theses</i> on the church door on that day, the
1st of November 1517, when the crowd could see and read
them.</p>

<p>The proceeding was strictly academic. The matter discussed,
to judge by the writings of theologians, was somewhat obscure;
and Luther offered his <i>theses</i> as an attempt to make it clearer.
No one was supposed to be committed to every opinion he
advanced in such a way. But the <i>theses</i> posted somehow touched
heart and conscience in a way unusual in the common subjects
of academic disputation. Every one wanted to read them.
The University Press could not supply copies fast enough. They
were translated into German, and were known throughout
Germany in less than a fortnight. Within a month they had
been heard of all over western and southern Europe. Luther
himself was staggered at the way they were received. He said
he had never meant to determine, but to debate.</p>

<p>The <i>theses</i> were singularly unlike what might have been
expected from a professor of theology. They made no attempt
at theological definition, no pretence at logical arrangement;
they were anything but a brief programme of reformation. They
were simply ninety-five sledge-hammer blows directed against
the most flagrant ecclesiastical abuse of the age. They were
addressed to the &ldquo;common&rdquo; man and appealed to his common
sense of spiritual things.</p>

<p>The practice of offering, selling and buying Indulgences
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indulgence</a></span>) was everywhere common in the beginning
of the 16th century. The beginnings go back more than a
thousand years before the time of Luther. In the earliest church
life, when Christians fell into sin, they were required to make
public confession before the congregation, to declare their sorrow,
and to vow to perform certain acts which were regarded as
evidence of the sincerity of their repentance. When the custom
of public confession before the congregation had changed to
private confession to the clergy, it became the confessor&rsquo;s duty
to impose these satisfactions. It was thought only right that
there should be some uniformity in dealing with repentant
sinners, and books appeared giving lists of sins and what were
supposed to be suitable satisfactions. When the sins confessed
were very heinous the satisfactions were correspondingly severe
and sometimes lasted over many years. About the 7th century
arose a custom of commuting or relaxing these imposed satisfactions.
A penance of several years fasting might be commuted
into saying so many prayers, or giving an arranged amount in
alms, or even into a money-fine. In the last case the analogy of
the Wergeld of the German tribal codes was commonly followed.
The usage generally took the form that any one who visited a
church, to which the Indulgence had been attached, on a day
named, and gave a contribution to its funds, had his penance
shortened by one-seventh, one-third or one-half, as might be
arranged. This was the origin of Indulgences properly so-called.
They were always mitigations of satisfactions or penances which
had been imposed by the church as outward signs of inward
sorrow, tests of fitness for pardon, and the needful precedents of
absolution. Luther uttered no protest against Indulgences
of this kind. He held that what the church had imposed the
church could remit.</p>

<p>This old and simple conception of Indulgences had been greatly
altered since the beginning of the 13th century. The institution
of penance had been raised to the dignity of a sacrament, and
this had changed both the place and the character of satisfactions.
Under the older conception the order had been Sorrow (<i>Contritio</i>),
Confession, Satisfaction (or due manifestation of sorrow in
ways prescribed) and Absolution. Under the newer theory
the order was Sorrow, Confession, Absolution, Satisfaction,
and both satisfaction and sorrow took new meanings. It was
held that Absolution removed guilt and freed from eternal
punishment, but that something had to be done to free the
penitent from temporal punishment whether in this life or in
purgatory. Satisfactions took the new meaning of the temporal
punishments due in this life and the substitute for the pains of
purgatory. The new thought of a treasury of merits (<i>thesaurus
meritorum</i>) introduced further changes. It was held that the
good deeds over and above what were needed for their own
salvation by the living or by the saints in heaven, together with
the inexhaustible merits of Christ, were all deposited in a treasury
out of which they could be taken by the pope and given by him
to the faithful. They could be added to the satisfactions actually
done by penitents. Thus Satisfactions became not merely signs
of sorrow but actual merits, which freed men from the need
to undergo the temporal pains here and in purgatory which their
sins had rendered them liable to. By an Indulgence merits
could be transferred from the storehouse to those who required
them. The change made in the character of Sorrow made
Indulgences all the more necessary for the indifferent penitent.
On the older theory Sorrow (<i>Contritio</i>) had for its one basis love
to God; but on the newer theory the starting-point might be
a less worthy king of sorrow (<i>Attritio</i>) which it was held would be
changed into the more worthy kind in the Sacrament of Penance.
The conclusion was naturally drawn that a process of penitence
which began with sorrow of the more unworthy kind needed a
larger amount of Satisfactions or penance than what began with
Contrition. Hence for the indifferent Christian, <i>Attrition</i>,
<i>Confession</i> and <i>Indulgence</i> became the three heads in the scheme
of the church of the later middle ages for his salvation. The one
thing which satisfied his conscience was the burdensome thing
he had to do, and that was to procure an Indulgence&mdash;a matter
made increasingly easy for him as time went on.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>This doctrine of <i>Attrition</i> had not the undivided support of the
theologians of the later medieval church; but it was taught by the
Scotists and was naturally a favourite theme with the sellers of
Indulgences. Nor were all theologians at one upon the whole theory
of Indulgences. The majority of the best theologians held that
Indulgences had nothing to do with the pardoning of guilt, but
only with freeing from temporal penalties in this life or in purgatory.
But the common people did not discriminate, and believed that
when they bought an Indulgence they were purchasing pardon from
sin; and Luther placed himself in the position of the ordinary
Christian uninstructed in the niceties of theological distinctions.</p>

<p>His <i>Ninety-five Theses</i> made six different assertions about Indulgences
and their efficacy:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span></p>

<p>i. An Indulgence is and can only be the remission of a merely
ecclesiastical penalty; the church can remit what the church has
imposed; it cannot remit what God has imposed.</p>

<p>ii. An Indulgence can never remit guilt; the pope himself cannot
do such a thing; God has kept that in His own hand.</p>

<p>iii. It cannot remit the divine punishment for sin; that also is in
the hands of God alone.</p>

<p>iv. It can have no efficacy for souls in Purgatory; penalties
imposed by the church can only refer to the living; death dissolves
them; what the pope can do for souls in Purgatory is by prayer,
not by jurisdiction or the power of the keys.</p>

<p>v. The Christian who has true repentance has already received
pardon from God altogether apart from an Indulgence, and does
not need one; Christ demands this true repentance from every one.</p>

<p>vi. The Treasury of Merits has never been properly defined; it
is hard to say what it is, and it is not properly understood by the
people; it cannot be the merits of Christ and of His saints, because
these act of themselves and quite apart from the intervention of the
pope; it can mean nothing more than that the pope, having the
power of the keys, can remit ecclesiastical penalties imposed by the
church; the true Treasure-house of merits is the Holy Ghost of the
grace and glory of God.</p>
</div>

<p>The unexpected effect of the <i>Theses</i> was that the sale of
Indulgences began to decline rapidly, and the archbishop of
Mainz, disappointed in his hopes of revenue, sent a copy to Rome.
The pope thinking that the whole dispute was a monkish quarrel,
contented himself with asking the general of the Augustinian
Eremites to keep his monks quiet. This was not easy. Tetzel,
in conjunction with a friend, Conrad Wimpina, had published
a set of counter-theses. John Mayr of Eck, a noted controversialist
and professor of theology in the university of Ingolstadt,
scented the Hussite heresy in the <i>Theses</i>, and denounced them
in a tract entitled <i>Obelisks</i>. Luther at once answered in his
<i>Asterisks</i>. A controversy raged in Germany. Meanwhile, at
Rome, Silvester Mazzolini of Prierio, a Dominican monk and
Inquisitor, had been studying the <i>Theses</i>, was profoundly
dissatisfied with them, and wrote a <i>Dialogue about the Power
of the Pope, against the presumptuous conclusions of Martin
Luther</i>. This book reached Germany about the middle of
January 1518, and increased the tumult.</p>

<p>Luther&rsquo;s friends had been provokingly silent about the <i>Theses</i>;
but in April 1518, at the annual chapter of the Augustinian
Eremites held at Heidelberg, Luther heard his positions temperately
discussed, and found somewhat to his astonishment that his
views were not acceptable to all his fellow monks. On his return
to Wittenberg he began an answer to his opponents. He carefully
considered his positions, found them unassailable, and
published his <i>Resolutions</i>, the most carefully written of all his
works. The book practically discarded all the ideas and practices
concerning Indulgences which had come into the medieval
church since the beginning of the 13th century, and all the
ingenious explanations of the scholastic theologians from
Bonaventura and Thomas Aquinas downwards. The effect of
the controversy was a great decrease in the sale of Indulgences
in Germany, and the Papal Curia saw with alarm a prolific
source of revenue decaying. It was felt that Luther must be
silenced. He was accordingly summoned to Rome. To obey
would have meant death; to refuse in his own name would
have been contumacy. But the peremptory summons could be
construed as an attack on the university of Wittenberg, and both
the elector of Saxony and the emperor Maximilian so regarded
it. The result was that Pope Leo cancelled the summons, and
it was arranged that Luther should appear before the papal
Legate to the German Diet, Thomas de Vio, Cardinal Cajedtan,
at Augsburg. The interview was not very successful. At its
conclusion Luther wrote two appeals&mdash;one from the pope ill-informed
to the pope well-informed, and the other to a General
Council. True to his habit of taking the German people into his
confidence, he wrote an account of his interview with the Legate,
and published it under the title of the <i>Acta Augustana</i>.</p>

<p>The publication greatly increased the sympathy of almost
all classes in Germany for Luther. They saw in him a pious man,
an esteemed professor, who had done nothing but propose a
discussion on the notoriously intricate subject of Indulgences,
peremptorily ordered to recant and to remain silent. The
elector Frederick shared the common feelings and resolved to
defend the man who had made his university so famous. His
action compelled the Roman Curia to pause. Germany was on
the eve, it was believed, of an election of a king of the Romans;
it was possible that an imperial election was not far distant;
Frederick was too important a personage to offend. So the
condemnation by the Cardinal-Legate was withdrawn for the
time, and the pope resolved to deal with the matter otherwise.
He selected one of his chamberlains, Charles von Miltitz, the
elector&rsquo;s private agent at Rome, and commissioned him to
deal with the matter as he best could. Miltitz received the
&ldquo;golden rose&rdquo; to give to Frederick, and was furnished with
several letters in all of which the pope spoke of Luther as a
&ldquo;child of the devil.&rdquo; His holiness had probably forgotten the
fact when he addressed Luther some months later as &ldquo;his dear
son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Miltitz arrived in Germany he discovered that the
movement was much more important than the Roman Curia had
imagined. He had not to deal with the opposition of a recalcitrant
monk, but with the awakening of a nation. He resolved to meet
with Tetzel and with Luther privately before he produced his
credentials. Tetzel he could not see; the man was afraid to leave
his convent; but he had lengthy interviews with Luther in the
house of Spalatin the chaplain and private secretary of the
elector Frederick. There he disowned the sermons of the pardon-sellers,
let it be seen that he did not approve of the action of the
Legate, and so prevailed with Luther that the latter promised to
write a submissive letter to the pope, to exhort people to reverence
the Roman See, to say that Indulgences were useful to remit
canonical penances, and to promise to write no more on the
matter unless he happened to be attacked. Luther did all this.
A reconciliation might have taken place had the Roman Curia
supported Miltitz. But the Curia did not support Miltitz,
and placed more faith in Eck, who was eager to extinguish
Luther in a public discussion.</p>

<p>Luther had been spending the time between his interview
with the Legate at Augsburg (Oct. 1518) and the Leipzig Disputation
(June 1519) in severe and disquieting studies. He
had found that all his opponents had pursued one line of argument:
the power to issue an Indulgence is simply one case of
the universal papal jurisdiction; Indulgences are what the
pope proclaims them to be, and to attack them is to attack the
power of the pope; the pope represents the Roman church,
which is actually the universal church, and to oppose the pope
is to defy the whole church of Christ; whoever attacks such
a long-established system as that of Indulgences is a heretic.
Such was the argument. Luther felt himself confronted with
the pope&rsquo;s absolute supremacy in all ecclesiastical matters.
It was a plea whose full force he felt. The papal supremacy was
one of his oldest inherited beliefs. He re-examined his convictions
about justifying faith and whether they did lead to his declarations
about Indulgences. He could come to no other conclusion.
It then became necessary to examine the papal claims.
He set himself to study the Decretals, and to his amazement
and indignation he found that they were full of frauds. It is
hard to say whether the discovery brought him more joy or more
grief. His letters show him half-exultant and half-terrified.
While he was in this state of mind he received Eck&rsquo;s challenge
to dispute with him at Leipzig on the papal supremacy.</p>

<p>This Leipzig Disputation was perhaps the most important
point in Luther&rsquo;s career. He met Eck in June 1519. It soon
appeared that the intention of that practised debater was to
force Luther into some admission which would justify opponents
in accusing him of holding the opinions of Huss, who had been
condemned by the great German Council of Constance. In
this he was eminently successful. Eck left Leipzig triumphant,
and Luther returned to Wittenberg much depressed. As usual
he wrote out and published an account of the Disputation,
which was an appeal to his fellow Germans. The result surpassed
his expectations. The Disputation made him see that his protest
against the abuses of Indulgences was no criticism of an excrescence
on the medieval ecclesiastical system, but an attack
on its centre of existence. He saw that he stood for the spiritual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>137</span>
priesthood of all believers and that medievalism in religion
meant that man cannot approach God without a priestly
mediator. The people also saw his position and rallied round
him; and the Humanists discerned in him a champion against the
old intolerance against which they had been revolting in vain.
Luther&rsquo;s depression fled. Sermons, pamphlets, letters from his
tireless pen flooded the land, and Luther began to be the leader
of a German revolt against Rome.</p>

<p>The year 1520 saw the publication of his three most important
works, all written at a time when he was fully convinced that
he had broken for ever with Rome. They were, <i>On the Liberty
of a Christian Man</i>, <i>An Address to the Nobility of the German
Nation</i>, and <i>On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church of God</i>&mdash;the
three primary treatises, as they have been called.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at Rome the pope had entrusted Eck and Prierias
with the preparation of a bull (<i>Exurge Domine</i>) against Luther&mdash;a
bull which followed the line of Eck&rsquo;s charges at Leipzig.
The reformer had been expecting it ever since the Disputation
at Leipzig, and had resolved to answer it by one striking act
which would impress the imagination of every man. He posted
up a notice inviting the Wittenberg students to witness the
burning of the bull (10th of December 1520). Rome had shot
its last ecclesiastical bolt. Nothing remained but an appeal
to the secular power, and this was at once prepared.</p>

<p>The emperor Maximilian had died suddenly (12th January
1519), and for long Germany was disturbed with intrigues about
the succession&mdash;the papal policy being specially tortuous.
The widely expressed desire for a German emperor secured the
unanimous election of Charles, the grandson of Maximilian
and the king of Spain. Never were a people more mistaken and
disappointed. The veins of Charles were full of German blood,
but he was his mother&rsquo;s son. It was the Spaniard, not the
German, who faced Luther at Worms.</p>

<p>Charles was crowned at Aachen, 23rd of October 1520, and
opened his first German diet at Worms, 22nd of January 1521.
The pope had selected two envoys to wait on the young emperor,
one of them, Jerome Aleander, being specially appointed to
secure the outlawry of Luther. The agenda of the diet contained
many things seriously affecting all Germany, but the one problem
which every one was thinking about was how Luther would be
dealt with. The Electoral College was divided. The archbishop
of Cologne, the elector of Brandenburg and his brother the
archbishop of Mainz were for instant outlawry, while the elector
of Saxony, who was resolved to protect Luther, had great
influence with the archbishop of Trier and the Count Palatine
of the Rhine.</p>

<p>Aleander had no difficulty in persuading Charles, while both
were still in the Netherlands, to put Luther under the ban
within his hereditary dominions, and the papal nuncio expected
that the decree would be extended to the whole German empire.
But Charles at first refused to deal summarily with Luther so
far as Germany was concerned. The emperor even wrote to the
elector of Saxony, asking him to bring Luther with him to the
diet for examination. Gradually he came to think that Luther
might be condemned without appearing. The members of the
diet were slow to come to any conclusion. At last they made
up their minds, and presented a memorial to the emperor
(19th of February 1521) in which they reminded him that no
imperial edict could be published against Luther without their
sanction, and proposed that he should be invited to Worms under
a safe-conduct and be there examined. They also suggested
that Luther should be heard upon the papal claims, and ended
by asking the emperor to deliver Germany from the papal
tyranny. The emperor agreed to summon Luther under a safe-conduct,
and that he should be heard; but he refused to mix
his case with that of grievances against Rome. He had no
sooner made the promise than he seems to have repented it.
He saw no need for Luther&rsquo;s appearance. He tried to get him
condemned unheard. An edict against Luther had been drafted
(15th of February) which the diet refused to sanction. A few
days later a second edict was drafted which ordered the burning
of Luther&rsquo;s books. The diet again objected. Finally four days
after the safe-conduct had been despatched the emperor revised
this second edict, limited it to the seizure of Luther&rsquo;s books,
and published it on his own authority without consulting the
diet (10th March). After Luther had begun his journey, this
edict was posted up along his route in order to intimidate him;
other means were taken to make him turn aside from Worms;
but he was resolved to go there and nothing daunted him. He
reached the town (16th April) and was met by encouraging
crowds. He was summoned to appear before the diet on the
17th and measures were taken to prevent him doing more than
answering definite questions put to him. He was asked whether
certain books had been written by him and whether he was
prepared to maintain or to abjure what he had written. He
asked time to prepare an answer to the second question. The
diet was anxious to hear Luther, if the emperor was not, and his
request was granted. He thus defeated the plot to keep him
silent. On the 18th he made his second appearance and delivered
the speech, which electrified his audience. At the close he was
threatened by Spaniards in the diet. The Germans ringed him
round, and, with their hands raised high in the fashion of a
landsknecht who had struck a successful blow, passed out into
the street and escorted him to his lodgings. Next day (April
19th) the emperor proposed to place Luther under the ban of
the empire and read to the assembly a brief statement of his
own views. The diet objected, and asked for a conference
between Luther and some selected members. Conferences were
held, but came to nothing. No compromise was possible between
the declaration that man&rsquo;s conscience could only be bound by
the Word of God and the emperor&rsquo;s belief in the infallibility of a
general council. The commission had to report that its efforts
had failed. Luther was ordered to leave Worms and to return
to Wittenberg. His safe-conduct was to expire twenty-one
days after the 16th of April. Then he was liable to be seized
and put to death as a pestilent heretic. There only remained
to draft and publish the edict containing the ban. Days passed
and it did not appear. Suddenly the startling news reached
Worms that Luther had disappeared, no one knew where. It
was reported that his body had been found in a silver-mine
pierced with a dagger. The news flew over Germany and
beyond it that he had been slain by papal emissaries. At Worms
the indignation of the populace was intense. The public buildings
were placarded during the night with an intimation that four
hundred knights had sworn not to leave Luther unavenged, and
the ominous words <i>Bundschuh, Bundschuh, Bundschuh</i> (the
watchword of peasant revolts) were written at the foot. The
combination suggested an alliance between the lesser knights
and the peasants, dreaded by all the ruling classes. The true
story of Luther&rsquo;s disappearance was not known until long afterwards.
After the failure of the conference the elector of
Saxony had commissioned two of the councillors to convey
Luther to a place of safety without telling him where it was.
Many weeks elapsed before Frederick himself learned that
Luther was safe in his own castle of the Wartburg. The disappearance
did not mean that Luther had ceased to be a leader
of men; but it marked the beginning of an organized national
opposition to Rome.</p>

<p>It was not till the 25th of May that the edict against Luther
was presented to a small number of members of the diet, after
the elector of Saxony and many important members had left
Worms. It threatened all Luther&rsquo;s sympathisers with extermination,
and practically proclaimed an Albigensian war in Germany.
But few public documents prepared with so much care have
proved so futile. The latter half of 1521 saw the silent spread
of Lutheran opinions all over Germany. This was not unaccompanied
with dangers. Every movement for reform
carries within it the seeds of revolution, and Luther&rsquo;s was no
exception to the rule.</p>

<p>The revolution began in Wittenberg during Luther&rsquo;s seclusion
in the Wartburg. Andrew Boden of Carlstadt, a colleague of
Luther&rsquo;s in the university of Wittenberg, was strongly impressed
with the contradiction which he believed to exist between
evangelical teaching and the usages of medieval ecclesiastical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span>
life. He denounced monastic vows, a distinctive dress for the
clergy, the thought of a propitiatory mass, and the presence of
images and pictures in the churches. Zwilling, a young Augustinian
Eremite, added his fiery denunciations. His preaching
stirred the commonalty. Turbulent crowds invaded two of the
churches and rioted inside. The excitement of the people was
increased by the arrival of three men known in history as the
<i>Zwickau prophets</i>. Melanchthon felt himself powerless to restrain
the tumult. The magistrates of the town were won over and
issued an ordinance which attempted to express in legislation
the new evangelical ideas. Duke George of Saxony, a resolute
opponent of the Reformation, threatened to make the diet
interfere. Luther became alarmed, and, not without a private
hint from the elector of Saxony,<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> left his retreat and appeared
among his townsmen. His presence and exertions restored
order, and the conservative reformation resumed its quiet course.
From this time onwards to the outbreak of the Peasants&rsquo; War
(1525) Luther was the real leader of the German nation, and everything
seemed to promise a gradual reformation without tumult.</p>

<p>The Peasants&rsquo; War ended this anticipation. From one point
of view this insurrection was simply the last, the most wide-spreading
and the most disastrous of these revolts, which had
been almost chronic in Germany during the later decades of the
15th and earlier years of the 16th century and which had been
almost continuous between 1503 and 1517. All the social and
economic causes which produced them were increasingly active
in 1524 and 1525. But it is undoubted that the religious revolt
intensified the rebellion of the lower classes. Luther&rsquo;s voice
awoke echoes he never dreamt of. The times were ripe for
revolution, and the message which spoke of a religious democracy
could not fail to suggest the social democracy also. In his
appeal to the <i>Nobility of the German Nation</i> he had stated with
severe precision the causes of social discontent. Himself a
peasant&rsquo;s son and acquainted with the grievances under which
the peasant lived, he had at various times formulated most
of the demands which afterwards figured conspicuously in the
Twelve Articles. The insurgents had good cause to regard him
as a sympathiser. But Luther, rightly or wrongly, believed
that of the two ways in which wrongs can be set right&mdash;the
way of war and the path of peace&mdash;the latter is the only sure
road in the long run. He did his best therefore to prevent the
rising and risked his life among the infuriated peasants as
readily as when he stood before the emperor and the diet.
When the rebellion was at its height and Thomas Münzer had
sent forth fiery proclamations urging the peasantry &ldquo;not to let
the blood cool on their swords,&rdquo; Luther issued the pamphlet,
which casts a stain on his whole life, in which he hounds on the
ruling classes to suppress the insurgents with all violence. In
the end the rebellion, formidable as it seemed for a few months,
was crushed, and a heavier yoke was laid on the shoulders of the
unfortunate peasants.</p>

<p>This year, 1525, saw the parting of the ways in the movement
for reform. It ceased to be national and became ecclesiastical.
It divided into three separate parts. One, guided by Luther
himself, ended, after a long struggle with pope and emperor,
in the establishment of evangelical churches under the rule of
the secular authorities of the territories which adopted the
Lutheran Reformation. Another, remaining true to the principles,
doctrines, usages and hierarchy of the medieval church,
dreamt only of a purification of moral life, and saw its end
realised in the reforms of the council of Trent. The third,
gathering together the more revolutionary impulses, expanded
into that complex movement called Anabaptism&mdash;which
spread over western Europe from England to Poland and
from Scandinavia to northern Italy, and endured a long and
sanguinary persecution at the hands of the civil authorities
in most European countries. Its strength and popularity,
especially among the artizan classes, have been very much
underrated by most historians.</p>

<p>During the storm of the Peasants&rsquo; War (13th of June 1525)
Luther married Catherine von Bora, the daughter of a noble
but impoverished family belonging to Meissen. She had been
a Cistercian nun in the convent of Nimtzch near Grimma&mdash;a
convent reserved for ladies of noble birth. Luther&rsquo;s writings,
circulating through Saxony, had penetrated the convent walls
and had convinced most of the inmates of the unlawfulness of
monastic vows. Catherine and eight companions resolved to
escape. Their relatives refused to aid them, and they applied
to Luther. He entrusted the business to Leonhard Koppe of
Torgau, and the rescue was safely carried out (4th of April 1523).
The rescued nuns found places of refuge in the families of
Wittenberg burghers. The elector John of Saxony (who had
succeeded his brother Frederick) gave Luther the house which
had served as the Augustinian Convent. The family gathered
in this three-storeyed building, with its back windows looking
over the Elbe and its front door opening on a great garden, was
latterly Luther and his wife, their three sons and two daughters,
Magdelena von Bora, Catherine&rsquo;s aunt, two orphan nieces and a
grandniece. At the beginning of his married life Luther must
have been in straitened circumstances. He married a portionless
nun. On to 1532 his salary was two hundred gulden annually
(about £160 in present money); after 1532 the stipend was
increased to £240 with various payments in kind&mdash;corn, wood,
malt, wine, &amp;c.&mdash;which meant a great deal more. The town
added occasional gifts to enable Luther to entertain the great
personages who came to consult him frequently. Princes made
him presents in money. This enabled Luther to purchase from
his wife&rsquo;s brother the small estate of Zulsdorf. Catherine, too,
was an excellent house-wife. She made the long-neglected
garden profitable; kept pigs and poultry; rented other gardens;
stocked a fishpond; farmed in a small way; and had her house
full of boarders. Luther had a high opinion of her intelligence;
she took rank among those consulted on all important occasions;
in one letter to her, seldom quoted, he gives the fairest statement
he ever made about the views of Zwingli on the Sacrament of
the Supper.</p>

<p>The diet of Speyer (1526) saw Germany divided into a Protestant
and a Romanist party. After much debate a compromise
was arrived at, which foreshadowed the religious peace of
Augsburg of 1555. It was resolved that the Word of God should
be preached without disturbance, that indemnity should be
given for past offences against the edict of Worms, and that
meanwhile each state should live religiously as it hoped to
answer for its conduct to God and the emperor. The Lutherans
interpreted this to mean the right to frame ecclesiastical regulations
for various principalities and to make changes in public
worship. Luther busied himself in simplifying the service, in
giving advice, anxiously sought for, about the best modes of
organising ecclesiastical affairs. In the diet held at Speyer
in 1529 a compact Roman Catholic majority faced a weak
Lutheran minority. The emperor declared through his commissioners
that he abolished &ldquo;by his imperial and absolute
authority&rdquo; the clause in the ordinance of 1526 on which the
Lutherans had relied when they began to organize their territorial
churches. The majority of the diet supported the emperor
in this, and further proceeded to decree that no ecclesiastical
body was to be deprived of its revenues or authority. This meant
that throughout all Germany medieval ecclesiastical rule was
to be upheld, and that none of the revenues of the medieval
church could be appropriated for Protestant uses. On this
a portion of the Protestant minority drafted a legal protest, in
which the signers declared that they meant to abide by the
decision of the diet of 1526 and refused to be bound by that of
1529. From this protest came the name <i>Protestant</i>.</p>

<p>A minority in such a case could only maintain their protest
if they were prepared to defend each other by force in case of an
attack. Three days after the protest had been read, many
of the protesting cities and states concluded &ldquo;a secret and
particular treaty,&rdquo; and Philip of Hesse, the ablest statesman
among the Protesters, saw the need for a general union of all
evangelical Christians in the empire. The difficulties in the way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>139</span>
were great. The Saxons and the Swiss, Luther and Zwingli,
were in fierce controversy about the true doctrine of the sacrament
of the Supper. Luther was a patriotic German who was
for ever bewailing the disintegration of the Fatherland; Zwingli
was full of plans for confederations of Swiss cantons with South
German cities, which could not fail to weaken the empire.
Luther had but little trust in the &ldquo;common man&rdquo;; Zwingli
was a thorough democrat. When Luther thought of the Swiss
reformer he muttered as Archbishop Parker did of John Knox&mdash;&ldquo;God
keep us from such visitations as Knox hath attempted in
Scotland; the people to be orderers of things.&rdquo; Above all
Luther had good grounds for believing that at the conference at
Memmingen friends of Zwingli had helped to organize a Peasants&rsquo;
War and to link the social revolution to the religious awakening.
All these suspicions were in Luther&rsquo;s mind when he consented
very half-heartedly to meet Zwingli at a conference to be held
in Philip of Hesse&rsquo;s castle at Marburg. The debate proceeded
as such debates usually do. Zwingli attacked the weakest part
of Luther&rsquo;s theory&mdash;the <i>ubiquity</i> of the body of Christ; and
Luther attacked Zwingli&rsquo;s exegesis of the words of the institution.
Neither sought to bring out their points of agreement. Yet the
conference did good; it showed that the Protestants were
agreed on all doctrinal points but one. If union was for the
present impossible, there were hopes for it in the future.</p>

<p>In 1530 the emperor Charles, resolved to crush the Reformation,
himself presided at the diet. The Protestant divisions
were manifest. Three separate confessions were presented to
the emperor&mdash;one from Zwingli, one by the theologians of the
four cities of Strassbourg, Constance, Lindau and Memmingen
(<i>Confessio Tetrapolitana</i>), and the <i>Augsburg Confession</i>, the future
symbol of the Lutheran church. The third was the most important,
and the emperor seriously set himself to see whether it
might not be made the basis of a compromise. He found that
reconciliation was hopeless. Thereupon the diet resolved that
the edict of Worms was to be enforced against Luther and his
partizans; that the ecclesiastical jurisdictions were to be preserved;
and that all the church property taken possession of by
the Lutheran princes was to be restored; and that in all cases of
dispute the last court of appeal was to be the Imperial Court of
Appeals. The last provision meant that the growing Protestantism
was to be fought by harrassing litigation&mdash;<i>nicht fechten
sondern rechten</i> was the phrase.</p>

<p>Luther was not present at the diet nor at the negotiations.
He was still an outlaw according to imperial ideas. Melanchthon
took his place as leader.</p>

<p>The decision of the diet compelled the Protestant princes to
face the new and alarming situation. They met in conference in
mid-winter at the little town of Schmalkald, and laid the foundations
of what became the powerful Schmalkald League, which
effectually protected the Protestants of Germany until it was
broken up by the intrigues of the imperial party. From the time
of the formation of this league, Luther retired gradually from
the forefront of a reformation movement which had become
largely political, and busied himself with reforms in public
worship and suggestions for an organization of the polity of the
Evangelical church. In this work his natural conservatism is
apparent, and he contented himself with such changes as would
make room for the action of evangelical principles. He disclaimed
the right of suggesting a common order of worship or a
uniform ecclesiastical polity; and Lutheran ritual and polity,
while presenting common features, did not follow one common
use. It may be said generally that while Luther insisted on a
service in the vernacular, including the singing of German
hymns, he considered it best to retain most of the ceremonies,
the vestments and the uses of lights on the altar, which had
existed in the unreformed church, while he was careful to explain
that their retention might be dispensed with if thought necessary.
To the popular mind the great distinction between the Lutheran
and the medieval church service, besides the use of the vernacular
and the supreme place assigned to preaching, was that the people
partook of the cup in the sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper; and
the Lutheran service became popularly distinguished from the
Reformed because it retained, while the Reformed did away
with, most of the medieval ceremonies and vestments (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lutherans</a></span>). The variations in the details of the polity of the
Lutheran churches were very numerous, but they all preserved
the same distinctive principles. Two conceptions lay at the
basis&mdash;the thought of the spiritual priesthood of all believers
and the belief that the state was a divine ordinance, that the
magistracy might represent the whole body of believers and that
discipline and administration might be exercised through courts
constituted somewhat like the consistorial courts of the medieval
bishops, their members being appointed by the magistracy.</p>

<p>The last years of Luther&rsquo;s life were spent in incessant labour
disturbed by almost continuous ill-health. He was occupied in
trying to unite firmly together the whole evangelical movement;
he laboured to give his countrymen a good system of schools;
he was on the watch to defeat any attempt of the Roman Curia
to regain its hold over Germany; and he was the confidential
adviser of a large number of the evangelical princes. Luther&rsquo;s
intimacy with his own elector, first John, then John Frederick,
helped to give him the place accorded to him by the princes.
The chiefs of the Houses of Anhalt and Lüneburg, Duke Henry
of Saxony, Joachim II. of Brandenburg, Albert of Brandenburg
and the counts of Mansfeld, were among Luther&rsquo;s most devoted
supporters and most frequently sought his advice. Princely
correspondence was not always pleasant. It took its most disagreeable
form when Philip of Hesse besieged Luther with
requests to give his sanction to taking a second wife while his
first was still alive. Luther&rsquo;s weakness brought the second great
blot on his career. The document sanctioning the bigamy of the
landgrave was signed by Martin Bucer, Luther and Melanchthon,
and is a humiliating paper. It may be thus summarized.
According to the original commandment of God, marriage is
between one man and one woman, and this original precept has
been confirmed by our Lord; but sin brought it about that
first Lamech, then the heathen, and then Abraham, took more
than one wife, and this was permitted under the law. We are
now living under the Gospel, which does not give prescribed
rules for the external life and has not expressly prohibited
bigamy. The law of the land expresses the original commandment
of God, and the plain duty of the pastorate is to denounce
bigamy. Nevertheless, the pastorate, in single cases of the direst
need and to prevent worse, may sanction bigamy in a purely
exceptional way. Such a bigamous marriage is a true marriage
in the sight of God (the necessity being proved), but it is not a
true marriage in the eye of public law and custom. Such a
marriage and the dispensation for it ought to be kept secret;
if it is made known, the dispensation becomes <i>eo ipso</i> invalid
and the marriage is mere concubinage. The principle which
underlies this extraordinary paper is probably the conception
that the Protestant church has the same dispensing power
which the medieval church claimed, but that it was to be exercised
altogether apart from fees of any kind.</p>

<p>In his later years Luther became more tolerant on the sacramental
question which divided him from the South German
cities, although he never departed from his strong opposition
to the supposed views of Zwingli himself. He consented to a
conference, which, as he was too ill to leave home, met at Wittenberg
(May-June 1536). After prolonged discussion the differences
were narrowed to one point&mdash;the presence of the body of
Christ <i>extended in space</i> in the sacrament of the Supper. It was
agreed in the <i>Wittenberg Concord</i> to leave this an open question.
Thus North and South Germany were united. It is possible that
had Luther lived longer his followers might have been united
with the Swiss. He repeatedly expressed an admiration for
Calvin&rsquo;s writings on the subject of the sacrament; and Melanchthon
believed that if the Swiss accepted Calvin&rsquo;s theory of the
Supper, the Wittenberg Concord could be extended to include
them. But the <i>Consensus Tigurinus</i>, which dates the adhesion
of the Swiss to the views of Calvin, was not signed until 1549,
when Luther was already dead.</p>

<p>Year by year Luther had been growing weaker, his attacks of
illness more frequent and his bodily pains more continuous.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>140</span>
Despite the entreaties of wife and elector he resolved to do
what he could to end some trifling dispute about inheritance
which threatened the peace of the House of Mansfeld. He left
Wittenberg in bitterly cold weather on the 23rd of January 1546,
and the journey was tedious and hazardous. He was accepted as
arbiter and his decision brought an end to the strife. He
preached in Eisleben (February 14) with all his old fervour;
but suddenly said quietly: &ldquo;This and much more is to be said
about the Gospel; but I am too weak and we will close here.&rdquo;
These were his last words in the pulpit. On the 16th and 17th
the deeds of reconciliation were signed and Luther&rsquo;s work was
done. The end came swiftly. He was very ill on the evening
of the 17th; he died on the early morning of the 18th of February
1546 in his sixty-third year.</p>

<p>The elector of Saxony and Luther&rsquo;s family resolved that he
must be buried at Wittenberg, and on the 20th the funeral procession
began its long march. The counts of Mansfeld, the
magistrates of the city and all the burghers of Eisleben accompanied
the coffin to the gates of their town. A company of fifty
light-armed troops commanded by the young counts of Mansfeld
headed the procession and went with it all the way to Wittenberg.
The following was temporarily swelled as it passed
through villages and towns. Delegates from the elector of
Saxony met it as it crossed the boundaries of the principality.
Luther was laid to rest in the Castle church on whose door he
had nailed the <i>theses</i> which had kindled the great conflagration.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUTHERANS,<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> the general title given to those Christians who
have adopted the principles of Martin Luther in his opposition
to the Roman Church, to the followers of Calvin, and to the
sectaries of the times of the Reformation. Their distinctive
name is the <i>Evangelical</i>, as opposed to the <i>Reformed</i> church.
Their dogmatic symbols are usually said to include nine separate
creeds which together form the <i>Book of Concord</i> (<i>Liber Concordiae</i>).
Three belong to the Early Christian church&mdash;the <i>Apostles&rsquo;
Creed</i>, the <i>Nicene Creed</i> (in its Western form, <i>i.e.</i> with the
<i>filioque</i>), and the so-called <i>Athanasian Creed</i>; six come from
the 16th century&mdash;the <i>Augsburg Confession</i>, the <i>Apology for the
Augsburg Confession</i>, the <i>Schmalkald Articles</i>, Luther&rsquo;s two
<i>Catechisms</i>, and the <i>Form of Concord</i>. But only the three
early creeds and the Augsburg Confession are recognized by
all Lutherans. Luther&rsquo;s Catechisms, especially the shorter
of the two, have been almost universally accepted, but the
Form of Concord was and is expressly rejected by many Lutheran
churches. The Augsburg Confession and Luther&rsquo;s Short Catechism
may therefore be said to contain the distinctive principles
which all Lutherans are bound to maintain, but, as the principal
controversies of the Lutheran church all arose after the publication
of the Augsburg Confession and among those who had
accepted it, it does not contain all that is distinctively Lutheran.
Its universal acceptance is perhaps due to the fact that it exists
in two forms (the <i>variata</i> and the <i>invariata</i>) which vary slightly
in the way in which they state the doctrine of the sacrament
of the Supper. The <i>variata</i> edition was signed by Calvin, in the
meaning, he said, of its author Melanchthon.</p>

<p>After Luther&rsquo;s death the more rigid Lutherans declared it
to be their duty to preserve the <i>status religionis in Germania
per Lutherum instauratus</i>, and to watch over the <i>depositum Jesu
Christi</i> which he had committed to their charge. As Luther was
a much greater preacher than a systematic thinker, it was not
easy to say exactly what this deposit was, and controversies
resulted among the Lutheran theologians of the 16th century.
The Antinomian controversy was the earliest (1537-1560).
It arose from differences about the precise meaning of the word
&ldquo;law&rdquo; in Luther&rsquo;s distinction between law and gospel. Luther
limited the meaning of the word to mean a definite command
accompanied by threats, which counts on terror to produce
obedience. He declared that Christ was not under the dominion
of the law in this sense of the word, and that believers enter
the Christian life only when they transcend a rule of life which
counts on selfish motives for obedience. But law may mean
ethical rule, and the Antinomians so understood it, and interpreted
Luther&rsquo;s declaration to mean that believers are not under
the dominion of the moral law. The controversy disturbed the
Lutheran church for more than twenty years.</p>

<p>The Arminian controversy in the Reformed church, the
Jansenist controversy in the Roman Catholic church, had their
parallel in three separate disputes among the Lutherans lasting
from 1550 to 1580. (1) George Major, discussing the relation
of good works to conversion, declared that such works were
both useful and necessary to holiness. He was attacked by
Flacius and Amsdorf, and after a long controversy, full of
ambiguities and lacking in the exhibition of guiding principles,
he was condemned because his statement savoured of Pelagianism.
(2) The same problem took a new form in the Synergist
controversy, which discussed the first impulse in conversion.
One party taught that while the first impulse must come from
the Holy Spirit the work might be compared to reviving a man
<i>apparently</i> dead. It was answered that the sinner was <i>really</i>
dead, and that the work of the Spirit was to give an actually
new life. The latter assertion was generally approved of. (3)
Then a fresh controversy was started by the assertion that sin
was part of the substance of man in his fallen condition. It
was answered that sin had not totally destroyed man&rsquo;s ethical
nature, and that grace changed what was morally insensitive
into what was morally sensitive, so that there could be a co-operation
between God&rsquo;s grace and man&rsquo;s will.</p>

<p>The controversy raised by Andrew Osiander was more important.
He felt that Luther had omitted to make adequate
answer to an important practical question, how Christ&rsquo;s death
on the cross could be brought into such actual connexion with
every individual believer as to be the ground of his actual
justification. The medieval church had spanned the centuries
by supposing that Christ&rsquo;s death was continuous down through
the age in the sacrifice of the Mass; Protestant theology had
nothing equivalent. He proposed to supply the lack by the
theory that justification is a real work done in the individual
by the same Christ who died so many centuries ago. Redemption,
he said, was the result of the historical work of Christ; but
justification was the work of the living risen Christ, dwelling
within the believer and daily influencing him. Osiander&rsquo;s
theory did not win much support, but it was the starting-point
of two separate doctrines. In the Lutheran church, Striegel
taught that the principal effect of Christ&rsquo;s work on the cross
was to change the attitude of God towards the whole human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span>
race, and that, in consequence, when men come into being and
have faith, they can take advantage of the change of attitude
effected by the past historical work of Christ. The Reformed
church, on the other hand, constructed their special doctrine
of the limited reference in the atonement.</p>

<p>The other controversies concerned mainly the doctrine of
the sacrament of the Supper, and Luther&rsquo;s theory of Consubstantiation.
This required a doctrine of <i>Ubiquity</i>, or the
omnipresence of the body of Christ extended in space, and
therefore of its presence in the communion elements. Calvin
had taught that the true way to regard substance was to think
of its power (<i>vis</i>), and that the presence of a substance was the
immediate application of its power. The presence of the body
of Christ in the sacramental elements did not need a presence
extended in space. Melanchthon and many Lutherans accepted
the theory of Calvin, and alleged that Luther before his death
had approved of it. Whereupon the more rigid Lutherans
accused their brethren of Crypto-Calvinism, and began controversies
which dealt with that charge and with a defence of the
idea of ubiquity.</p>

<p>The university of Jena, led by Matthias Flacius, was the
headquarters of the stricter Lutherans, while Wittenberg and
Leipzig were the centres of the Philippists or followers of
Melanchthon. Conferences only increased the differences.
The Lutheran church seemed in danger of falling to pieces.
This alarmed both parties. New conferences were held and
various articles of agreement were proposed, the most notable
being the <i>Torgau Book</i> (1576). In the end, the greater proportion
adopted the <i>Book of Concord</i> (1577), drafted chiefly by Jacob
Andreae of Tübingen, Martin Chemnitz of Brunswick and
Nicolas Selnecker of Leipzig. Its recognition was mainly due
to the efforts of Augustus, elector of Saxony. This <i>Book of
Concord</i> was accepted by the Lutheran churches of Sweden and
of Hungary in 1593 and 1597; but it was rejected by the
Lutheran churches of Denmark, of Hesse, of Anhalt, of Pomerania
and of several of the imperial cities. It was at first adopted and
then rejected by Brunswick, the Palatinate and Brandenburg.
The churches within Germany which refused the <i>Book of Concord</i>
became for the most part Calvinistic or Reformed. They
published, as was the fashion among the Reformed churches,
separate creeds for themselves, but almost all accepted the
<i>Heidelberg Catechism</i>. These differences in the German Protestant
churches of the second half of the 16th century are
reflected in the great American Lutheran church. The church
exists in three separate organizations. The General Synod of
the Evangelical Church of the United States, organized in 1820,
has no other creed than the <i>Augsburg Confession</i>, so liberally
interpreted as not to exclude Calvinists. The Synodical Conference
of North America, organized in 1872, compels its pastors
to subscribe to the whole of the nine creeds contained in the
Book of Concord. The General Council, a secession from the
General Synod, was organized in 1867, and accepts the &ldquo;unaltered&rdquo;
(<i>invariata</i>) <i>Augsburg Confession</i> in its original sense,
and the other Lutheran symbols as explanatory of the Augsburg
Confession.</p>

<p>The divided state of German Protestantism, resulting from
these theological differences, contributed in no small degree
to the disasters of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, and various attempts
were made to unite the two confessions. Conferences were held
at Leipzig (1631), Thorn (1645), Cassel (1661); but without
success. At length the union of the two churches was effected
by the force of the civil authorities in Prussia (1817), in Nassau
(1817), in Hesse (1823), in Anhalt-Dessau (1827) and elsewhere.
These unions for the most part aimed, not at incorporating the
two churches in doctrine and in worship, but at bringing churches
or congregations professing different confessions under one
government and discipline. They permitted each congregation
to use at pleasure the <i>Augsburg Confession</i> or the <i>Heidelberg
Catechism</i>. The enforced union in Prussia was combined with
the publication of a new liturgy intended for common use. This
led to secessions from the state church. These seceders were
at first treated with great harshness, but have won their
way to toleration, and form the Lutheran Free churches of
Germany.</p>

<p>The most important of these latter is the Evangelical Lutheran
church of Prussia, sometimes called the Old Lutherans. It
came into being in 1817 and gradually gained the position of a
tolerated nonconformist church (1845 being the date of its
complete recognition by the state). At the 1905 census it
numbered 51,600 members under 75 pastors. Its affairs are
managed by an <i>Oberkirchencollegium</i>, with four ordained and
two lay members. The Evangelical Lutheran Immanuel Synod
came into being in 1864, and has a membership of 5300 with
13 ordained pastors. Its headquarters is Liegnitz. The Independent
Evangelical Lutheran church in the lands of Hesse
arose partly on account of the slumbering opposition to the
union of 1823 and more particularly in consequence of an attempt
made at a stricter union in 1874. It has a membership of about
1800. The <i>renitente</i> church of Lower Hesse has a membership
of 2400. The Evangelical Lutheran Free Church of Hanover
has a membership of 3050 under 10 ordained pastors. The
Hermannsburg Free Church has a membership of about 2000
under 2 pastors. The Evangelical Lutheran Community in
Baden has a membership of about 1100 with 2 ordained pastors.
The Evangelical Lutheran Free Church of Saxony has a membership
of about 3780 with 15 ordained pastors. These free churches
exist separate from the State Evangelical United Church (<i>Evangelische
unirte Landskirche</i>).</p>

<p>The general system of ecclesiastical government which prevails
among all Lutheran churches is called the <i>consistorial</i>. It
admits of great variety of detail under certain common features
of organization. It arose partly from the makeshift policy of
the times of the Reformation, and partly from Luther&rsquo;s strong
belief that the <i>jus episcopale</i> belonged in the last resort to the
civil authorities. It may be most generally described by saying
that the idea was taken from the consistorial courts through
which the medieval bishops managed the affairs of their dioceses.
Instead of the appointments to the membership of the consistories
being made by the bishops, they were made by the
supreme civil authority, whatever that might be. Richter, in
his <i>Evangelische Kirchenordnungen des 16ten Jahrhunderts</i>
(2 vols., 1846), has collected more than one hundred and eight
separate ecclesiastical constitutions, and his collection is confessedly
imperfect. The publication of a complete collection
by Emil Sehling was begun in 1902.</p>

<p>The liturgies of the Lutheran churches exhibit the same
diversities in details as appear in their constitutions. It may
be said in general that while Luther insisted that public worship
ought to be conducted in a language understood by the people,
and that all ideas and actions which were superstitious and
obscured the primary truth of the priesthood of all believers
should be expurged, he wished to retain as much as possible
of the public service of the medieval church. The external
features of the medieval churches were retained; but the minor
altars, the <i>tabernacula</i> to contain the Host, and the light permanently
burning before the altar, were done away with. The
ecclesiastical year with its fasts and festivals was retained in
large measure. In 1526 Luther published the <i>German Mass and
order of Divine Service</i>, which, without being slavishly copied,
served as a model for Lutheran communities. It retained the
altar, vestments and lights, but explained that they were not
essential and might be dispensed with. The peril attending the
misuse of pictures in churches was recognized, but it was believed
to be more than counterbalanced by the instruction given through
them when their presence was not abused. In short Luther
contented himself with setting forth general principles of divine
service, leaving them to be applied as his followers thought best.
The consequence was that there is no uniform Lutheran liturgy.
In his celebrated <i>Codex Liturgicus Ecclesiae Lutheranae in
epitomen redactus</i> (Leipzig, 1848), Daniel has used 98 different
liturgies and given specimens to show the differences which they
exhibit.</p>

<p>The divergences in ritual and organization, the principle
underlying all the various ecclesiastical unions, viz. to combine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>142</span>
two different confessions under one common government, and,
resulting from it, the possibility of changing from one confession
to another, have all combined to free the state churches from any
rigid interpretation of their theological formulas. A liberal and
a conservative theology (rationalist and orthodox) exist side by
side within the churches, and while the latter clings to the
theology of the 16th century, the former ventures to raise doubts
about the truth of such a common and simple standard as the
Apostles&rsquo; Creed. The extreme divergence in doctrinal position
is fostered by the fact that the theology taught in the universities
is in a great measure divorced from the practical religious
life of the people, and the theological opinions uttered in the
theological literature of the country cannot be held to express
the thoughts of the members of the churches. In each state the
sovereign is still held to be the <i>summus episcopus</i>. He appoints
a minister of public worship, and through him nominates the
members of the governing body, the <i>Oberkirchenrath</i> or <i>Consistorium</i>
or <i>Directorium</i>. This council deals with the property,
patronage and all other ecclesiastical matters. But each parish
elects its own council for parochial affairs, which has a legal
status and deals with such matters as the ecclesiastical assessments.
Delegates from these parish councils form the <i>Landessynode</i>.
In cases that call for consultation together, the <i>Consistorium</i>
and the Synod appoint committees to confer. In
Alsace-Lorraine about half of those entitled to vote appear at
the polls; but in other districts of Germany very little interest
is shown in the elections to the parish councils.</p>

<p>The income of the state churches is derived from four sources.
The state makes an annual provision for the stipends of the
clergy, for the maintenance of fabrics and for other ecclesiastical
needs. The endowments for church purposes, of which there
are many, and which are destined to the support of foreign
missions, clerical pensions, supply of books to the clergy, &amp;c.
are administered by the supreme council. The voluntary
contributions of the people are all absorbed in the common
income of the national churches and are administered by the
supreme council. Each parish is legally entitled to levy ecclesiastical
assessments for defined purposes.</p>

<p>Appointments to benefices are in the hands of the state
(sometimes with consent of parishes), of private patrons and
of local parish councils. The number of these benefices is always
increasing; and in 1897 they amounted to 16,400, or 300 more
than in 1890. The state appoints to 56%, private and municipal
patrons to 34%, and congregations to 10% of the whole.
Customs vary in different states; thus in Schleswig-Holstein
the state nominates but the parish elects; in Alsace-Lorraine
the directorium or supreme consistory appoints, but the
appointment must be confirmed by the viceroy; in Baden the
state offers the parish a selection from six names and then
appoints the one chosen.</p>

<p>The Lutheran state churches of Denmark, Sweden and Norway
have retained the episcopate. In all of them the king is recognized
to be the <i>summus episcopus</i> or supreme authority in all
ecclesiastical matters, but in Norway and Sweden his power is
somewhat limited by that of parliament. The king exercises
his ecclesiastical authority through a minister who superintends
religion and education. The position and functions of
the bishops vary in the different countries. In all the rite of
ordination is in their hands. In Denmark they are the inspectors
of the clergy and of the schools. In Sweden they preside over
local consistories composed of clerical and lay members. The
episcopate in all three countries accommodates itself to something
like the Lutheran consistorial system of ecclesiastical
government.</p>

<p>The two leading religions within Germany are the Evangelical
(Lutheran) and the Roman Catholic, including respectively 58
and 39% of the population. The proportions are continually
varying, owing to the new migratory habits of almost every
class of the population. Generally speaking, the Roman Catholics
are on the increase in Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Württemburg;
and the Evangelicals in the other districts of Germany,
especially in the large cities. There is a growing tendency to
mixed marriages, which are an important factor in religious
changes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUTHER LEAGUE,<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> a religious association for young people
in the United States of America. It began with a local society
founded by delegates of six Lutheran church societies in New
York City in 1888. The first national convention was held at
Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, on the 30th and 31st of October 1895.
The basis of the league is the Augsburg Confession. Its membership
is open to &ldquo;any society of whatever name connected with a
Lutheran congregation or a Lutheran institution of learning.&rdquo;
According to the constitution its objects are &ldquo;to encourage
the formation of the young people&rsquo;s societies in all Lutheran
congregations in America, to urge their affiliation with their
respective state or territorial leagues, and with this league to
stimulate the various young people&rsquo;s societies to greater Christian
activity and to foster the spirit of loyalty to the church.&rdquo; The
league publishes a monthly paper, <i>The Luther League Review</i>, in
Washington. According to its official report it had 70,000
members in 1906, which had increased to more than 100,000 in
1910.</p>

N.W. by N. of London by the Midland railway, served also by a
branch of the Great Northern. Pop. (1901) 36,404. It lies in a
narrow valley on the south flank of the Chiltern Hills, on the
upper part of the river Lea. The church of St Mary is mainly
Decorated, but has portions of Early English and Perpendicular
work. It has brasses and monuments of interest and a late
Decorated baptistery of stone, an ornate roofed structure,
octagonal in form. The font within it is Early English. Luton
is the principal seat in England of the straw-plait manufacture,
and large quantities of hats and other straw goods have been
exported, though in recent years the industry has suffered from
increased foreign competition. The industry originated with the
colony of straw-plaiters transplanted by James I. from Scotland,
whither they had been brought from Lorraine by Queen Mary.
The town has also foundries, motor car works and other manufactures.
The borough is under a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18
councillors. Area, 3133 acres.</p>

Kovel. Pop. (1900) 17,701. It is supposed to have been founded
in the 7th century; in the 11th century it was known as Luchesk,
and was the chief town of an independent principality. In the
15th century it was the seat of a bishop and became wealthy, but
during the wars between Russia and Poland in the second half
of the 16th century, and especially after the extermination of
its 40,000 inhabitants, it lost its importance. In 1791 it was
taken by Russia. Its inhabitants, many of them Jews, live
mainly by shipping goods on the Styr. Among its buildings is a
16th-century castle. Lutsk is the seat of a Roman Catholic

<p><span class="bold">LUTTRELL, HENRY<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1765-1851), English wit and writer of
society verse, was the illegitimate son of Henry Lawes Luttrell,
2nd earl of Carhampton (1743-1821), a grandson of Colonel
Henry Luttrell (<i>c.</i> 1655-1717), who served James II. in Ireland
in 1689 and 1690, and afterwards deserted him, being murdered
in Dublin in November 1717. Colonel Luttrell&rsquo;s son Simon
(1713-1787) was created earl of Carhampton in 1785, and the
latter&rsquo;s son was Henry Lawes Luttrell. Before succeeding to the
peerage, the 2nd earl, then Colonel Luttrell, had won notoriety
by opposing John Wilkes at the Middlesex election of 1769.
He was beaten at the poll, but the House of Commons declared
that he and not Wilkes had been elected. In 1796 he was made
commander of the forces in Ireland and in 1798 he became a
general. Being an Irish peer, Carhampton was able to sit in
the English parliament until his death in April 1821. The earldom
became extinct on the death of his brother John, the 3rd
earl, in 1829.</p>

<p>Henry Luttrell secured a seat in the Irish parliament in 1798
and a post in the Irish government, which he commuted for a
pension. Introduced into London society by the duchess of
Devonshire, his wit made him popular. Soon he began to write
verse, in which the foibles of fashionable people were outlined.
In 1820 he published his <i>Advice to Julia</i>, of which a second edition,
altered and amplified, appeared in 1823 as <i>Letters to Julia in
Rhyme</i>. This poem, suggested by the ode to Lydia in the first
book of Horace&rsquo;s Odes, was his most important work. His more
serious literary contemporaries nicknamed it &ldquo;Letters of a
Dandy to a Dolly.&rdquo; In 1827 in <i>Crockford House</i> he wrote a satire
on the high play then in vogue. Byron characterized him as
&ldquo;the best sayer of good things, and the most epigrammatic
conversationist I ever met&rdquo;; Sir Walter Scott wrote of him as
&ldquo;the great London wit,&rdquo; and Lady Blessington described him
as the one talker &ldquo;who always makes me think.&rdquo; Luttrell died
in London on the 19th of December 1851.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LÜTZEN,<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> a town in Prussian Saxony, in the circle of Merseburg
(pop. in 1905, 3981), chiefly famous as the scene of a great battle
fought on the 6/16th of November 1632 between the Swedes,
under King Gustavus Adolphus, and the Imperialists, under
Wallenstein. On the 5/15th November, Gustavus, with some
20,000 men, advanced from Naumburg on the Saale to meet a
contingent of his German allies at Grimma, S.E. of Leipzig, but
becoming aware of the presence of Wallenstein&rsquo;s army near
Lützen, and that it had been weakened by a large detachment
sent away under Pappenheim towards Halle, he turned towards
Lützen. Wallenstein&rsquo;s posts at Weissenfels and Rippach prevented
him from fighting his main battle the same evening, and
the Swedes went into camp near Rippach, a little more than an
hour&rsquo;s march from Lützen.</p>

<p>Wallenstein made ready to give battle on the following day
and recalled Pappenheim. The latter had taken a small castle,
the reduction of which was one of the objects of his expedition,
but his men had dispersed to plunder and could not be rallied
before the following morning. Gustavus had now to choose
between proceeding to Grimma and fighting Wallenstein on the
chance that Pappenheim had not rejoined. He chose the latter.
In the mist of the early morning Wallenstein&rsquo;s army was formed
in line of battle along the Leipzig road with its right on Lützen.
Its left was not carried out as far as the Flossgraben in order
to leave room on that flank for Pappenheim. His infantry
was arranged in five huge oblongs, four of which (in lozenge
formation) formed the centre and one the right wing at Lützen.
These &ldquo;battalias&rdquo; had their angles strengthened in the old-fashioned
way that had prevailed since Marignan, with small
outstanding bodies of musketeers, so that they resembled
rectangular forts with bastions. On either side of this centre
was the cavalry in two long lines, while in front of the centre
and close to the right at Lützen were the two batteries of heavy
artillery. Lützen was set on fire as a precaution. Skirmishers
lined the bank and the ditch of the Leipzig road. The total
strength of the Imperial army was about 12,000 foot and 8000
horse.</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:527px; height:544px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img143.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Gustavus&rsquo;s hopes of an early decision were frustrated by the
fog, which delayed the approach and deployment of the Swedes.
It was 8 <span class="scs">A.M.</span> before all was ready. The royal army was in two
lines. The infantry in the centre was arrayed in the small and
handy battalions then peculiar to Gustavus&rsquo;s army, the horse
on either wing extended from opposite Lützen to some distance
beyond Wallenstein&rsquo;s left, which Pappenheim was to extend
on his arrival. By the accident of the terrain, or perhaps,
following the experience of Breitenfeld (<i>q.v.</i>), by design, the
right of the Swedes was somewhat nearer to the enemy than
the left. In front, near the centre, were the heavy guns and
each infantry battalion had its own light artillery. The force
of infantry and cavalry on either side was about equal, the
Swedes had perhaps rather less cavalry and rather more infantry,
but their artillery was superior to Wallenstein&rsquo;s. Not until
11 was it possible to open fire, for want of a visible target, but
about noon, after a preliminary cannonade, Gustavus gave the
word to advance.</p>

<p>The king himself commanded the right wing, which had to
wait until small bodies of infantry detached for the purpose had
driven in the Imperialist skirmish line, and had then to cross
a ditch leading the horses. They were not charged by the
Imperialists at this moment, for Pappenheim had not yet
arrived, and the usual cavalry tactics of the day were founded
on the pistol and not on the sword and the charging horse.
Gaining at last room to form, the Swedes charged and routed
the first line of the Imperial cavalry but were stopped by the
heavy squadrons of cuirassiers in second line, and at that
moment Gustavus galloped away to the centre where events
had taken a serious turn. The Swedish centre (infantry) had
forced their way across the Leipzig road and engaged Wallenstein&rsquo;s
living forts at close quarters. The &ldquo;Blue&rdquo; brigade&mdash;Gustavus&rsquo;s
infantry wore distinctive colours&mdash;overran the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
battery of heavy guns, and the &ldquo;Swedish&rdquo;<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and &ldquo;Yellow&rdquo;
brigades engaged the left face of the Imperialist lozenge with
success. But a gap opened between the right of the infantry
and the left of the cavalry and Wallenstein&rsquo;s second line squadrons
pressed into it. It was this which brought Gustavus from the
extreme right, and he was killed here in leading a counter charge.</p>

<p>On the extreme left, meanwhile, the &ldquo;Green&rdquo; brigade had
come to close quarters with Wallenstein&rsquo;s infantry and guns
about Lützen, and the heavy artillery had gone forward to
close range between the &ldquo;Green&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Yellow&rdquo; infantry.
But the news of Gustavus&rsquo;s death spread and the fire of the
assault died out. Wallenstein advanced in his turn, recaptured
his guns and drove the Swedes over the road.</p>

<p>But the fiery Duke Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar took up the
command and ordered a fresh advance. He was too good a
soldier to waste his reserves and only brought up a few units
of the second line to help the disordered brigades of the first.
Again the Imperialists were driven in and their guns recaptured,
this time all along the line. About three in the afternoon the
Swedes were slowly bearing back Wallenstein&rsquo;s stubborn infantry
when Pappenheim appeared. The famous cavalry leader had
brought on his mounted men ahead of the infantry and asking,
&ldquo;Where is the king of Sweden?&rdquo; charged at once in the direction
of the enemy&rsquo;s right. Wallenstein thus gained time to reestablish
his order, and once more the now exhausted brigades
of the Swedish first line were driven over the road. But Pappenheim
fell in the moment of victory and his death disheartened
the Imperialists almost as much as the fall of Gustavus had
disheartened the Swedes. For the last time Bernhard, wounded
as he was, forced the Swedish army to the attack. The three
infantry brigades of his second line had not been engaged,<a name="fa2e" id="fa2e" href="#ft2e"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
and as usual the last closed reserve, resolutely handled, carried
the day. Wallenstein&rsquo;s army gave way at all points and the
Swedes slept on the battlefield. The infantry of Pappenheim&rsquo;s
corps did not appear on the field until the battle was over.
Of the losses on either side no accurate statement can be given,
but the Swedish &ldquo;Green&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yellow&rdquo; brigades are said to
have lost five-sixths of their numbers. Near the spot where
Gustavus fell a granite boulder was placed in position on the
day after the battle. A canopy of cast-iron was erected over
this &ldquo;Schwedenstein&rdquo; in 1832, and close by, a chapel, built
by Oskar Ekman. a citizen of Gothenburg (d. 1907), was dedicated
on the 6th of November 1907.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LÜTZOW, ADOLF,<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> <span class="sc">Freiherr von</span> (1782-1834), Prussian
lieutenant-general, entered the army in 1795, and eleven years
later as a lieutenant took part in the disastrous battle of Auerstädt.
He achieved distinction in the siege of Colberg, as the
leader of a squadron of Schill&rsquo;s volunteers. In 1808, as a major,
he retired from the Prussian army, indignant at the humiliating
treaty of Tilsit. He took part in the heroic venture of his old
chief Schill in 1809; wounded at Dodendorf and left behind,
he thereby escaped the fate of his comrades. In 1811 he was
restored to the Prussian army as major, and at the outbreak
of the &ldquo;war of liberation&rdquo; received permission from Scharnhorst
to organize a &ldquo;free corps&rdquo; consisting of infantry, cavalry and
Tirolese marksmen, for operating in the French rear and rallying
the smaller governments into the ranks of the allies. This
corps played a marked part in the campaign of 1813. But
Lützow was unable to coerce the minor states, and the wanderings
of the corps had little military influence. At Kitzen (near
Leipzig) the whole corps, warned too late of the armistice of
Poischwitz, was caught on the French side of the line of demarcation
and, as a fighting force, annihilated. Lützow himself,
wounded, cut his way out with the survivors, and immediately
began reorganizing and recruiting. In the second part of the
campaign the corps served in more regular warfare under
Wallmoden. Lützow and his men distinguished themselves
at Gadebusch (where Körner fell) and Göhrde (where Lützow
himself, for the second time, received a severe wound at the
head of the cavalry). Sent next against Denmark, and later
employed at the siege of Jülich, Lützow in 1814 fell into the hands
of the French. After the peace of 1814 the corps was dissolved,
the infantry becoming the 25th Regiment, the cavalry the 6th
Ulans. At Ligny he led the 6th Ulans to the charge, but they
were broken by the French cavalry, and he finally remained in
the hands of the enemy, escaping, however, on the day of
Waterloo. Made colonel in this year, his subsequent promotions
were: major-general 1822, and lieutenant-general (on retirement)
1830. He died in 1834. One of the last acts of his
life for which Lützow is remembered is his challenge (which was
ignored) to Blücher, who had been ridden down in the rout of
the 6th Ulans at Ligny, and had made, in his official report,
comments thereon, which their colonel considered disparaging.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUXEMBURG, FRANÇOIS HENRI DE MONTMORENCY-BOUTEVILLE,<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span>
<span class="sc">Duke of</span> (1628-1695), marshal of France, the
comrade and successor of the great Condé, was born at Paris
on the 8th of January 1628. His father, the comte de Montmorency-Bouteville,
had been executed six months before his
birth for killing the marquis de Beuvron in a duel, but his aunt,
Charlotte de Montmorency, princess of Condé, took charge of
him and educated him with her son, the duc d&rsquo;Enghien. The
young Montmorency (or Bouteville as he was then called)
attached himself to his cousin, and shared his successes and
reverses throughout the troubles of the Fronde. He returned
to France in 1659 and was pardoned, and Condé, then much
attached to the duchesse de Châtillon, Montmorency&rsquo;s sister,
contrived the marriage of his adherent and cousin to the greatest
heiress in France, Madeleine de Luxemburg-Piney, princesse
de Tingry and heiress of the Luxemburg dukedom (1661),
after which he was created duc de Luxembourg and peer of
France. At the opening of the War of Devolution (1667-68),
Condé, and consequently Luxemburg, had no command, but
during the second campaign he served as Condé&rsquo;s lieutenant-general
in the conquest of Franche Comté. During the four
years of peace which followed Luxemburg cultivated the favour
of Louvois, and in 1672 held a high command against the Dutch.
He defeated the prince of Orange at Woerden and ravaged
Holland, and in 1673 made his famous retreat from Utrecht to
Maestricht with only 20,000 men in face of 70,000, an exploit
which placed him in the first rank of generals. In 1674 he was
made captain of the gardes du corps, and in 1675 marshal of
France. In 1676 he was placed at the head of the army of the
Rhine, but failed to keep the duke of Lorraine out of Philipsburg;
in 1677 he stormed Valenciennes; and in 1678 he defeated the
prince of Orange, who attacked him at St Denis after the signature
of the peace of Nijmwegen. His reputation was now high,
and it is reputed that he quarrelled with Louvois, who managed
to involve him in the &ldquo;affair of the poisons&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">La Voisin,
Catherine</a></span>) and get him sent to the Bastille. Rousset in his
<i>Histoire de Louvois</i> has shown that this quarrel is probably
apocryphal. There is no doubt that Luxemburg spent some
months of 1680 in the Bastille, but on his release took up his
post at court as <i>capitaine des gardes</i>. When the war of 1690
broke out, the king and Louvois recognized that Luxemburg
was the only general fit to cope with the prince of Orange, and
he was put in command of the army of Flanders. On the 1st
of July 1690 he won a great victory over the prince of Waldeck at
Fleurus. In the following year he commanded the army which
covered the king&rsquo;s siege of Mons and defeated William III.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>145</span>
of England at Leuze on September 18, 1691. Again in the
next campaign he covered the king&rsquo;s siege of Namur, and
defeated William at Steenkirk (<i>q.v.</i>) on June 5, 1692; and on
July 29, 1693, he won his greatest victory over his old adversary
at Neerwinden, after which he was called <i>le tapissier de Nôtre
Dame</i> from the number of captured colours that he sent to the
cathedral. He was received with enthusiasm at Paris by all
but the king, who looked coldly on a relative and adherent of
the Condés. St Simon describes in the first volume of his
<i>Memoirs</i> how, instead of ranking as eighteenth peer of France
according to his patent of 1661, he claimed through his wife
to be duc de Piney of an old creation of 1571, which would place
him second on the roll. The affair is described with St Simon&rsquo;s
usual interest in the peerage, and was chiefly checked through
his assiduity. In the campaign of 1694, Luxemburg did little
in Flanders, except that he conducted a famous march from
Vignamont to Tournay in face of the enemy. On his return to
Versailles for the winter he fell ill, and died on January 4, 1695.
In his last moments he was attended by the famous Jesuit
priest Bourdaloue, who said on his death, &ldquo;I have not lived his
life, but I would wish to die his death.&rdquo; Luxemburg&rsquo;s morals
were bad even in those times, and he had shown little sign of
religious conviction. But as a general he was Condé&rsquo;s grandest
pupil. Though slothful like Condé in the management of a
campaign, at the moment of battle he seemed seized with happy
inspirations, against which no ardour of William&rsquo;s and no
steadiness of Dutch or English soldiers could stand. His death
and Catinat&rsquo;s disgrace close the second period of the military
history of the reign of Louis XIV., and Catinat and Luxemburg,
though inferior to Condé and Turenne, were far superior to
Tallard and Villeroi. He was distinguished for a pungent wit.
One of his retorts referred to his deformity. &ldquo;I never can
beat that cursed humpback,&rdquo; William was reputed to have said
of him. &ldquo;How does he know I have a hump?&rdquo; retorted
Luxemburg, &ldquo;he has never seen my back.&rdquo; He left four sons,
the youngest of whom was a marshal of France as Maréchal
de Montmorency.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUXEMBURG,<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> a district in the European low countries,
of which the eastern part forms the grand-duchy of Luxemburg,
and the western is the Belgian province of that name (for map,
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Belgium</a></span>). The name is derived from the chief town.</p>

<p>Under the Romans the district was included in the province
of <i>Belgica prima</i>, afterwards forming part of the Frankish
kingdom of Austrasia and of the empire of Charlemagne. About
1060 it came under the rule of Conrad (d. 1086), who took the
title of count of Luxemburg. His descendants ruled the county,
first in the male and then in the female line, until the death of
the emperor Sigismund in 1437. Through the marriage of
Sigismund&rsquo;s daughter, Elizabeth, with the German king, Albert II.,
Luxemburg, which had been made a duchy in 1354, passed to
the house of Habsburg, but was seized in 1443 by Philip III.
the Good, duke of Burgundy, who based his claim upon a bargain
concluded with Sigismund&rsquo;s niece Elizabeth (d. 1451). Regained
by the Habsburgs in 1477 when Mary, daughter and heiress of
duke Charles the Bold, married the German king Maximilian I.,
the duchy passed to Philip II. of Spain in 1555, though subject
to the laws of the empire, of which it still formed part. After
a section had been ceded to France in 1659, the remainder was
given to the emperor Charles VI. by the treaty of Utrecht in
1713. It was conquered by France in 1795, and retained by
that power until the end of the Napoleonic wars. The congress
of Vienna (1814-1815) erected Luxemburg into a grand-duchy,
added part of the duchy of Bouillon to it, and assigned it to
William I., king of the Netherlands, in return for the German
territories of the house of Orange-Nassau, which Napoleon had
confiscated in 1806, and which were given by the congress to the
king of Prussia. In 1830 when the Belgian provinces separated
from Holland, an effort was made to include Luxemburg in the
new kingdom of the Belgians; but in November 1831 the powers
decided that part of the grand-duchy should be retained by
the king of Holland, who refused to accept this arrangement.
Consequently the whole of Luxemburg remained in the possession
of the Belgians until 1838, when the treaty of the 19th of April,
concluded at the conference of London, enforced the partition
of 1831.</p>

<p>The grand-duchy of Luxemburg, the portion under the rule
of William I. retaining the name, was ruled by the kings of
Holland until the death of William III. in 1890. William&rsquo;s
daughter, Wilhelmina, succeeded to the throne of Holland,
but under the Salic law<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> the grand-duchy passed to his kinsman,
Adolphus, duke of Nassau, who died in 1905, and was succeeded
by his son William (b. 1852).</p>

<p>By modifications of the treaty of Vienna the garrisoning of
the fortress of Luxemburg had passed into Prussian hands,
an arrangement which lasted until 1867. In the previous year
the German Confederation, to which the grand-duchy of Luxemburg
had belonged since 1815, had been dissolved; but the
Prussians maintained their garrison in Luxemburg, which was
not included in the new North German Confederation, while
King William III. proposed to sell his rights over the grand-duchy
to France. The Prussians were irritated by this proposal, but
war was averted, and the question was referred to a conference
of the powers in London. The treaty of London, signed on the
11th of May 1867, decided that the Prussian garrison must be
withdrawn and the fortress dismantled, which was done in 1872.
At the same time the great powers guaranteed the neutrality
of the grand-duchy, and although a member of the German
<i>Zollverein</i>, Luxemburg now forms a sovereign and independent
state.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Grand-Duchy</span> lies S.E. of Belgium. Its area is 999 sq. m.,
with a population (1905) of 246,455. The people are nearly
all Catholics. The country is rich in iron ore. The hills in the
south of the duchy are a continuation of the Lorraine plateau,
and the northern districts are crossed in all directions by outrunners
from the Ardennes. The streams mostly join the Moselle,
which forms the boundary between Luxemburg and the Rhine
province for about 20 m. The Sure or Sauer, the most important
stream in the duchy, rises at Vaux-les-Rosières in Belgian
Luxemburg, crosses the duchy, and forms the eastern boundary
from the confluence of the Our till it joins the Moselle after a
course of 50 m., during which it receives the Wiltz, Attert,
Alzette, White and Black Ernz, &amp;c. The soil of Luxemburg is
generally good; the southern districts are on the whole the most
fertile as well as the most populous. Building materials of all
sorts are obtained throughout the duchy. Besides the iron
furnaces, situated in the south near the Lorraine plateau, there
are tanneries, weaving and glove-making factories, paper-mills
for all sorts of paper, breweries and distilleries, and sugar refineries.
A German patois mixed with French words is spoken throughout
the country; but French, which is employed by the commercial
community, is also the common speech on the French and
Belgian frontiers. Though liberty of worship prevails, Roman
Catholicism is almost the sole form. The government is in the
hands of the grand-duke, who sanctions and promulgates the
laws. There is a council (<i>staatsrat</i>) of 15 members. There is a
chamber of deputies with 48 members elected by the cantons
(12 in number) for six years, half the body being elected every
three years. No law can be passed without the consent of the
chamber. Bills are introduced by the grand-duke, but the
house has also the right of initiative. A single battalion (150)
of volunteers composes the grand-ducal army. The gendarmerie
consists of about 150 men. There are cantonal courts and two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>146</span>
district courts, one at Luxemburg, the other at Diekirch, and
a high court at Luxemburg. The bishopric of Luxemburg
holds its authority directly from the Holy See. From 13,000,000
to 17,000,000 francs is the annual amount of the state budget,
and the debt, consisting of loans contracted principally for the
construction of railways, of which there are about 350 m., is
12,000,000 francs.</p>

<p>Among towns next to the capital, Luxemburg, are Echternach
and Diekirch, both worthy of note for their blast furnaces.
Grevenmacher is the centre of a great wine district.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Province of Luxemburg</span> is the largest and least populous
of the nine provinces of Belgium. Its capital is Arlon, which lies
near the borders of the grand-duchy. A considerable part of
the province is forested and the state requires systematic replanting.
Marble, granite and slate quarries are worked in
different districts. Successful attempts have been made to
introduce fruit cultivation. The province is well watered by
the Ourthe, the Semois and the Sûre. The general elevation of
the country is about 500 ft., but the hills and plateaus which
form the prominent feature in the scenery of Luxemburg range
from 1200 to 1500 ft. The highest point of the province is the
Baraque de Fraiture (1980 ft.), N.E. of La Roche. The woods
are well stocked with red and roe deer, wild boar, hares, rabbits,
pheasants, woodcock and snipe. The area of the province is
1725 sq. m. The population was 225,963 in 1904.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <span class="sc">House of Luxemburg</span> was descended from Count Conrad
(d. 1086), and its fortunes were advanced through the election of
Count Henry IV. as German king in 1308 and his coronation as
emperor under the title of Henry VII. Henry&rsquo;s son was John, king
of Bohemia, who fell on the field of Crécy, and John&rsquo;s eldest son
was the emperor Charles IV., while another famous member of the
family was Baldwin, archbishop of Treves (1285-1354), who took an
active part in imperial affairs. Two of the sons of Charles IV.,
Wenceslaus and Sigismund, succeeded in turn to the imperial
throne, and one of his nephews, Jobst, margrave of Moravia, was
chosen German king in opposition to Sigismund in 1410. The
French branch of the Luxemburg family was descended from
Waleran (d. 1288), lord of Ligny and Roussy, a younger son of
Count Henry II. Waleran&rsquo;s great-grandson was Guy (d. 1371), who
married Matilda, sister and heiress of Guy V., count of Saint-Pol
(d. 1360), and was created count of Ligny in 1367. Guy&rsquo;s son,
Waleran (d. 1417), who became constable of France in 1412, had been
carried as a prisoner to England, and had married Matilda, daughter
of Thomas Holland, earl of Kent (d. 1360) and half-sister of King
Richard II. To avenge Richard&rsquo;s death he made a raid on the Isle
of Wight, and then took part in the civil wars in France. He left
no sons, and was succeeded by his nephew, Peter, count of Brienne
(d. 1433), who, like his brother Louis (d. 1443), cardinal archbishop
of Rouen and chancellor of France, was found on the side of the
English in their struggle against France. Another of Peter&rsquo;s brothers,
John (d. 1440), a stout supporter of England, was made governor of
Paris by Henry V. He sold Joan of Arc to the English. Peter&rsquo;s son
and successor, Louis, fought at first for England, but about 1440 he
entered the service of France and obtained the office of constable.
King Louis XI. accused him of treachery, and he took refuge with
Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy; but the duke handed him
over to the king and he was beheaded in 1475. The elder branch of
his descendants became extinct in the male line in 1482, and was
merged through the female line in the house of Bourbon-Vendôme.
Louis&rsquo;s third son, Anthony (d. 1510), founded the family of Luxemburg-Brienne,
the senior branch of which became extinct in 1608.
A junior branch, however, was the family of the duke of Luxemburg-Piney,
whose last representative, Margaret-Charlotte (d. 1680),
married firstly Léon d&rsquo;Albert de Luynes (d. 1630) and secondly
Charles Henry de Clermont-Tonnerre (d. 1674). Her daughter by
her second husband, Madeleine Charlotte, married Francis Henry
de Montmorenci (d. 1695) and de Luynes, and, subsequently,
members of the family of Montmorenci claimed the title of duke of
Luxemburg. The Luxembourg palace in Paris owes its name to
the fact that it was built on a site belonging to the duke of Luxemburg-Piney.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUXEMBURG,<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Lützelburg</span> (<i>i.e.</i> the little fortress or
town), the capital of the grand-duchy of the same name (see
above), situated on the Alzette, a tributary of the Sûre. Pop.
(1905) 20,984. The situation is romantic, steep cliffs overhanging
the winding river, and the principal portion of the
town with the palace and public buildings covering a central
plateau. The more densely populated parishes of Clausen,
Pfaffenthal and Grund lie in the valley. As a fortress Luxemburg
was considered the strongest in Europe after Gibraltar,
which it was supposed to resemble because many of its casemates
were cut into the rock. It was dismantled in 1867. Two colossal
viaducts carry the railway and the approach from the railway
station to the town. Since the place ceased to be a fortress the
population has more than doubled, and the Alzette is lined
with tanneries, breweries and distilleries. The Hôtel de Ville
dates from 1844 and contains a collection of antiquities. The
church of Notre Dame was built in 1613, and that of St Michael,
with parts dating from 1320, contains the tomb of blind John of
Luxemburg, king of Bohemia, slain at Crécy. There are two
annual fête days, one in honour of Our Lady of Luxemburg,
patroness of the city, held on the Sunday before Ascension Day,
and the other the annual fair or <i>Schobermesse</i> (tent fair),
instituted in 1340 and held each year on the 24th of August.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUXEUIL-LES-BAINS,<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> a town of eastern France, in the
department of Haute-Saône, 18 m. N.E. of Vesoul. Pop. (1906)
5195. It is situated in a region of forests on the right bank of
the Breuchin. It has an abbey-church dating from the 13th
and 14th centuries, containing a curious 17th-century organ
loft in the form of an immense bracket supported by a colossal
figure of Hercules. The abbot&rsquo;s palace (16th and 18th centuries)
serves as presbytery and town hall. A cloister of the 15th
century and other buildings of the 17th century also remain.
There are several mansions and houses dating from various
periods from the 14th to the 16th century. The Maison Carrée,
once the town hall, an interesting specimen of 15th-century
architecture, was built by Perrin Jouffroy, father of Cardinal
Jouffroy. The cardinal, who was born at Luxeuil in 1412, built
the house with a graceful balcony and turret which faces the
Maison Carrée. The Maison de la Baille and the Maison François
I. are of the Renaissance period. The fine modern Grammont
Hospital is in the style of Louis XIII. Luxeuil is renowned for
its mineral springs, of which there are seventeen, two being
ferruginous, and the rest charged with chloride of sodium;
their temperatures range from 70° to 158° F. The water is
employed for drinking and for baths. The bathing establishment
contains a museum of Gallo-Roman antiquities and there are
also remains of Roman baths and aqueducts to be seen in or
near it. Luxeuil has a communal college. Copper-founding,
the spinning and weaving of cotton, lace-making, dyeing and
the distilling of kirsch are carried on.</p>

<p>Luxeuil was the Roman <i>Lixovium</i> and contained many fine
buildings at the time of its destruction by the Huns under
Attila in 451. In 590 St Columban here founded a monastery,
afterwards one of the most famous in Franche Comté. In the
8th century it was destroyed by the Saracens; afterwards
rebuilt, monastery and town were devastated by the Normans
in the 9th century and plllaged on several occasions afterwards.
The abbey schools were celebrated in the middle ages and the
abbots had great influence; but their power was curtailed by
the emperor Charles V. and the abbey was suppressed at the
Revolution.</p>

kasr), a town of Upper Egypt, on the east bank of the Nile 450 m.
above Cairo by river and 418 by rail. Pop. (1907 census)
12,644. It is the centre for visitors to the ruins of and about
Thebes, and is frequented by travellers and invalids in the winter
season, several fine hotels having been built for their accommodation.
There are Anglican and Roman Catholic churches,
and a hospital for natives, opened in 1891. The district is the
seat of an extensive manufacture of forged antiques.</p>

<p>The temple of Luxor is one of the greatest of the monuments
of Thebes (<i>q.v.</i>). It stands near the river bank on the S.W. side
of the town and measures nearly 300 yds. from back to front.
There may have been an earlier temple here, but the present
structure, dedicated to the Theban triad of Ammon, Mut and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span>
Khons, was erected by Amenophis III. The great colonnade,
which is its most striking feature, was apparently intended for
the nave of a hypostyle hall like that of Karnak, but had to
be hastily finished without the aisles. After the heresy of
Amenophis IV. (Akhenaton), the decoration of this incomplete
work was taken in hand by Tutenkhamun and Haremhib. The
axis of the temple ran from S.W. to N.E.; a long paved road
bordered by recumbent rams led from the façade to the temples
of Karnak (<i>q.v.</i>) in a somewhat more easterly direction, and
Rameses II. adopted the line of this avenue in adding an extensive
court to the work of Amenophis, producing a curious change of
axis. He embellished the walls and pylons of his court with
scenes from his victories over Hittites and Syrians, and placed
a number of colossal statues within it. In front of the pylon
Rameses set up colossi and a pair of obelisks (one of which was
taken to Paris in 1831 and re-erected in the Place de la Concorde).
A few scenes and inscriptions were added by later kings, but the
above is practically the history of the temple until Alexander
the Great rebuilt the sanctuary itself. The chief religious
festival of Thebes was that of &ldquo;Southern Opi,&rdquo; the ancient name
of Luxor. The sacred barks of the divinities preserved in the
sanctuary of Karnak were then conveyed in procession by water
to Luxor and back again; a representation of the festal scenes
is given on the walls of the great colonnade. The Christians built
churches within the temple. The greater part of the old village
of Luxor lay inside the courts: it was known also as Abu &lsquo;l
Haggag from a Moslem saint of the 7th century, whose tomb-mosque,
mentioned by Ibn Batuta, stands on a high heap of
débris in the court of Rameses. This is the last of the buildings
and rubbish which encumbered the temple before the expropriation
and clearances by the Service des Antiquités began in
1885. The principal street of Luxor follows the line of the
ancient avenue.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUYNES,<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> a territorial name belonging to a noble French
house. The family of Albert, which sprang from Thomas
Alberti (d. 1455), seigneur de Boussargues, <i>bailli</i> of Viviers and
Valence, and <i>viguier</i> of Bagnols and Pont St Esprit in Languedoc,
acquired the estate of Luynes (dep. of Indre-et-Loire) in the
16th century. Honoré d&rsquo;Albert (d. 1592), seigneur de Luynes,
was in the service of the three last Valois kings and of Henry IV.,
and became colonel of the French bands, commissary of artillery
in Languedoc and governor of Beaucaire. He had three sons:
Charles (1578-1621), first duke of Luynes, and favourite of
Louis XIII.; Honoré (1581-1649), seigneur de Cadenet, who
married Charlotte Eugénie d&rsquo;Ailly, countess of Chaulnes, in 1619,
and was created duke of Chaulnes in 1621; and Léon, seigneur
de Brantes, who became duke of Luxemburg-Piney by his
marriage in 1620 with Margaret Charlotte of Luxemburg.</p>

<p>By her marriage with Claude of Lorraine, duke of Chevreuse,
Marie de Rohan, the widow of the first duke of Luynes, acquired
in 1655 the duchy of Chevreuse, which she gave in 1663 to Louis
Charles d&rsquo;Albert, her son by her first husband; and from that
time the title of duke of Chevreuse and duke of Luynes was borne
by the eldest sons of the family of Luynes, which also inherited
the title of duke of Chaulnes on the extinction of the descendants
of Honoré d&rsquo;Albert in 1698. The branch of the dukes of Luxemburg-Piney
became extinct in 1697.</p>

<p>Charles (1578-1621), the first duke of Luynes, was brought up
at court and attended the dauphin, who later became Louis XIII.
The king shared his fondness for hunting and rapidly advanced
him in favour. In 1615 he was appointed commander of the
Louvre and counsellor, and the following year grand falconer
of France. He used his influence over the king in the court
intrigues against the queen-mother Marie de Medici and her
favourite Concini. It was Luynes who, with Vitry, captain
of the guard, arranged the plot that ended in Concini&rsquo;s assassination
(1617) and secured all the latter&rsquo;s possessions in Italy and
France. In the same year he was appointed captain of the
Bastille and lieutenant-general of Normandy, and married Marie
de Rohan, daughter of the duke of Montbazon. He employed
extreme measures against the pamphleteers of the time, but
sought peace in Italy and with the Protestants. In 1619 he
negotiated the treaty of Angoulême by which Marie de Medici
was accorded complete liberty. He was made governor of
Picardy in 1619; suppressed an uprising of nobles in 1620; and
in 1621, with slight military ability or achievement, was appointed
constable of France. His rapid rise to power made him
a host of enemies, who looked upon him as but a second Concini.
In order to justify his newly-won laurels, Luynes undertook an
expedition against the Protestants, but died of a fever in the
midst of the campaign, at Longueville in Guienne, on the 15th
of December 1621.</p>

<p>His brother Honoré (1581-1649), first duke of Chaulnes, was

his province successfully in 1625 and 1635. Louis Auguste

<p><span class="bold">LUZÁN CLARAMUNT DE SUELVES Y GURREA, IGNACIO<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span>
(1702-1754), Spanish critic and poet, was born at Saragossa on
the 28th of March 1702. His youth was passed under the care
of his uncle, and, after studying at Milan, he graduated in
philosophy at the university of Catania. In 1723 he took minor
orders, but abandoned his intention of entering the church and
took up his residence at Naples, where he read assiduously.
Business took him to Spain in 1733, and he became known in
Madrid as a scholar with a tendency towards innovations in
literature. <i>La Poética, ó Reglas de la poesía en general y de sus
principales especies</i> (1737) proved that this impression was
correct. He at once took rank as the leader of the literary
reformers, and his courteous determination earned him the
respect of his opponents. In 1747 he was appointed secretary to
the Spanish embassy in Paris and, on returning to Madrid in
1750, was elected to the &ldquo;Academia Poética del Buen Gusto,&rdquo;
where, on account of his travels, he was known by the sobriquet
of <i>El Peregrino</i>. He became master of the mint and treasurer of
the royal library. He died at Madrid, after a short illness, on
the 19th of May 1754. Luzán was not the pioneer of Franco-Italian
theories in Spain, but he was their most powerful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span>
exponent, and his <i>Poética</i> is an admirable example of destructive
criticism. The defects of Lope de Vega and Calderón are indicated
with vigilant severity, but on the constructive side Luzán
is notably weak, for he merely proposes to substitute one exhausted
convention for another. The doctrine of the dramatic
unities had not the saving virtues which he ascribed to it, and,
though he succeeded in banishing the older dramatists from
the boards, he and his school failed to produce a single piece of
more than mediocre merit. His theories, derived chiefly from
Muratori, were ineffective in practice; but their ingenuity
cannot be denied, and they acted as a stimulus to the partisans
of the national tradition.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUZ-SAINT-SAUVEUR,<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> a town of south-western France in
the department of Hautes-Pyrénées, 21 m. S. of Lourdes by rail.
Pop. (1906) 1069. Luz is beautifully situated at a height of
2240 ft. on the Bastan. It has a remarkable church, built by the
Templars in the 12th and 13th centuries and fortified later.
The crenelated ramparts with which it is surrounded, and the
tower to the north of the apse resembling a keep, give it the aspect
of a fortress; other interesting features are the Romanesque
north door and a chapel of the 16th century. The village of St
Sauveur lies a little above Luz on the left bank of the gorge of
the Gave de Pau, which is crossed higher up by the imposing
Pont Napoléon (1860). It is a pleasant summer resort, and is
visited for its warm sulphurous springs. Discovered in the 16th
century, the waters came into vogue after 1820, in which year
they were visited by the duchesses of Angoulême and Berry.
There is much picturesque mountain scenery in the vicinity;
12 m. to the south is the village of Gavarnie, above which is the
magnificent rock amphitheatre or <i>cirque</i> of Gavarnie, with its
cascade, one of the highest in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LUZZATTI, LUIGI<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> (1841-&emsp;&emsp;), Italian economist and
financier, was born of Jewish parents at Venice on the 11th of
March 1841. After completing his studies in law at the university
of Padua, he attracted the attention of the Austrian police by his
lectures on political economy, and was obliged to emigrate.
In 1863 he obtained a professorship at the Milan Technical
Institute; in 1867 he was appointed professor of constitutional
law at Padua, whence he was transferred to the university
of Rome. Gifted with eloquence and energy, he popularized
in Italy the economic ideas of Schultze-Delitzsch, worked for
the establishment of a commercial college at Venice, and contributed
to the spread of people&rsquo;s banks on a basis of limited
liability throughout the country. In 1869 he was appointed by
Minghetti under secretary of state to the ministry of agriculture
and commerce, in which capacity he abolished government
control over commercial companies and promoted a state
inquiry into the conditions of industry. Though theoretically a
free trader, he was largely instrumental in creating the Italian
protective system. In 1877 he participated in the commercial
negotiations with France, in 1878 compiled the Italian customs
tariff, and subsequently took a leading part in the negotiations
of all the commercial treaties between Italy and other countries.
Appointed minister of the treasury in the first Di Rudini cabinet
of 1891, he imprudently abolished the system of frequent clearings
of bank-notes between the state banks, a measure which
facilitated the duplication of part of the paper currency and
hastened the bank crisis of 1893. In 1896 he entered the second
Di Rudini cabinet as minister of the treasury, and by timely
legislation helped to save the bank of Naples from failure.
After his fall from office in June 1898, his principal achievement
was the negotiation of the Franco-Italian commercial treaty,
though, as deputy, journalist and professor, he continued to take
an active part in all political and economic manifestations.
He was again minister of the treasury from November 1903 to
March 1905 in Giolitti&rsquo;s second administration, and for the third
time from February to May 1906, under Sonnino&rsquo;s premiership.
During the latter term of office he achieved the conversion of the
Italian 5% debt (reduced to 4% by the tax) to 3¾% to be
eventually lowered to 3½%, an operation which other ministers
had attempted without success; although the actual conversion
was not completed until after the fall of the cabinet of
which he formed part the merit is entirely his. In 1907 he was
president of the co-operative congress at Cremona.</p>

and mystic, was born in Padua 1707, and died at Acre 1747. He
was influenced by Isaac Luria (<i>q.v.</i>) on the mystical side, and
on the poetical side by Italian drama of the school of Guarini
(<i>q.v.</i>). He attacked Leon of Modena&rsquo;s anti-Kabbalistic treatises,
and as a result of his conflict with the Venetian Rabbinate left
Italy for Amsterdam, where, like Spinoza, he maintained himself
by grinding lenses. Here, in 1740, he wrote his popular
religious manual the <i>Path of the Upright</i> (<i>Messilath Yesharim</i>)
and other ethical works. He visited London, but finally settled
in Palestine, where he died. Luzzatto&rsquo;s most lasting work is in
the realm of Hebrew drama. His best-known compositions are:
the <i>Tower of Victory</i> (<i>Migdal &rsquo;Oz</i>) and <i>Glory to the Upright</i>
(<i>Layesharim Tehillah</i>). Both of these dramas, which were not
printed at the time but were widely circulated in manuscript, are
of the type which preceded the Shakespearean age&mdash;they are
allegorical and all the characters are types. The beautiful
Hebrew style created a new school of Hebrew poetry, and the
Hebrew renaissance which resulted from the career of Moses
Mendelssohn owed much to Luzzatto.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYCANTHROPY<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="lykos">&#955;&#973;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>, wolf, <span class="grk" title="anthrôpos">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span>, man), a name
employed (1) in folk-lore for the liability or power of a human
being to undergo transformation into an animal; (2) in pathology
for a form of insanity in which the patient believes that he is
transformed into an animal and behaves accordingly.</p>

<p>I. Although the term lycanthropy properly speaking refers to
metamorphosis into a wolf (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Werwolf</a></span>), it is in practice used
of transformation into any animal. The Greeks also spoke of
kynanthropy (<span class="grk" title="kyôn">&#954;&#973;&#969;&#957;</span>, dog); in India and the Asiatic islands the
tiger is the commonest form, in North Europe the bear, in Japan
the fox, in Africa the leopard or hyena, sometimes also the lion,
in South America the jaguar; but though there is a tendency
for the most important carnivorous animal of the area to take
the first place in stories and beliefs as to transformation, the less
important beasts of prey and even harmless animals like the deer
also figure among the wer-animals.</p>

<p>Lycanthropy is often confused with transmigration; but the
essential feature of the wer-animal is that it is the alternative
form or the double of a living human being, while the soul-animal
is the vehicle, temporary or permanent, of the spirit of a dead
human being. The vampire is sometimes regarded as an example
of lycanthropy; but it is in human form, sometimes only a head,
sometimes a whole body, sometimes that of a living person,
at others of a dead man who issues nightly from the grave to prey
upon the living.</p>

<p>Even if the denotation of lycanthropy be limited to the animal-metamorphosis
of living human beings, the beliefs classed
together under this head are far from uniform, and the term is
somewhat capriciously applied. The transformation may be
voluntary or involuntary, temporary or permanent; the wer-animal
may be the man himself metamorphosed, it may be his
double whose activity leaves the real man to all appearance
unchanged, it may be his soul, which goes forth seeking whom
it may devour and leaving its body in a state of trance; or it
may be no more than the messenger of the human being, a real
animal or a familiar spirit, whose intimate connexion with its
owner is shown by the fact that any injury to it is believed, by
a phenomenon known as repercussion, to cause a corresponding
injury to the human being.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of repercussion, the power of animal metamorphosis,
or of sending out a familiar, real or spiritual, as a
messenger, and the supernormal powers conferred by association
with such a familiar, are also attributed to the magician, male
and female, all the world over; and witch superstitions are
closely parallel to, if not identical with, lycanthropic beliefs,
the occasional involuntary character of lycanthropy being
almost the sole distinguishing feature. In another direction the
phenomenon of repercussion is asserted to manifest itself in connexion
with the bush-soul of the West African and the <i>nagual</i> of
Central America; but though there is no line of demarcation to
be drawn on logical grounds, the assumed power of the magician
and the intimate association of the bush-soul or the <i>nagual</i> with
a human being are not termed lycanthropy. Nevertheless it will
be well to touch on both these beliefs here.</p>

<p>In North and Central America, and to some extent in West
Africa, Australia and other parts of the world, every male
acquires at puberty a tutelary spirit (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Demonology</a></span>); in
some tribes of Indians the youth kills the animal of which he
dreams in his initiation fast; its claw, skin or feathers are put
into a little bag and become his &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; and must be carefully
retained, for a &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; once lost can never be replaced.
In West Africa this relation is said to be entered into by means
of the blood bond, and it is so close that the death of the animal
causes the man to die and vice versa. Elsewhere the possession
of a tutelary spirit in animal form is the privilege of the magician.
In Alaska the candidate for magical powers has to leave the
abodes of men; the chief of the gods sends an otter to meet him,
which he kills by saying &ldquo;O&rdquo; four times; he then cuts out its
tongue and thereby secures the powers which he seeks. The
Malays believe that the office of <i>pawang</i> (priest) is only hereditary
if the soul of the dead priest, in the form of a tiger, passes into
the body of his son. While the familiar is often regarded as the
alternative form of the magician, the <i>nagual</i> or bush-soul is
commonly regarded as wholly distinct from the human being.
Transitional beliefs, however, are found, especially in Africa,
in which the power of transformation is attributed to the whole
of the population of certain areas. The people of Banana are
said to change themselves by magical means, composed of human
embryos and other ingredients, but in their leopard form they
may do no hurt to mankind under pain of retaining for ever
the beast shape. In other cases the change is supposed to be
made for the purposes of evil magic and human victims are
not prohibited. We can, therefore, draw no line of demarcation,
and this makes it probable that lycanthropy is connected with
nagualism and the belief in familiar spirits, rather than with
metempsychosis, as Dr Tylor argues, or with totemism, as suggested
by J. F. M&lsquo;Lennan. A further link is supplied by the Zulu
belief that the magician&rsquo;s familiar is really a transformed human
being; when he finds a dead body on which he can work his
spells without fear of discovery, the wizard breathes a sort of
life into it, which enables it to move and speak, it being thought
that some dead wizard has taken possession of it. He then burns
a hole in the head and through the aperture extracts the tongue.
Further spells have the effect of changing the revivified body
into the form of some animal, hyena, owl or wild cat, the latter
being most in favour. This creature then becomes the wizard&rsquo;s
servant and obeys him in all things; its chief use is, however,
to inflict sickness and death upon persons who are disliked by
its master.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Lycanthropy in Europe.</i>&mdash;The wolf is the commonest form of the
wer-animal (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Werwolf</a></span>), though in the north the bear disputes
its pre-eminence. In ancient Greece the dog was also associated
with the belief. Marcellus of Sida, who wrote under the Antonines,
gives an account of a disease which befell people in February; but
a pathological state seems to be meant.</p>

<p><i>Lycanthropy in Africa.</i>&mdash;In Abyssinia the power of transformation
is attributed to the Boudas, and at the same time we have records
of pathological lycanthropy (see below). Blacksmiths are credited
with magical powers in many parts of the world, and it is significant
that the Boudas are workers in iron and clay; in the <i>Life of N.
Pearce</i> (i. 287) a European observer tells a story of a supposed transformation
which took place in his presence and almost before his
eyes; but it does not appear how far hallucination rather than
coincidence must be invoked to explain the experience.</p>

<p><i>The Wer-tiger of the East Indies.</i>&mdash;The Poso-Alfures of central
Celebes believe that man has three souls, the <i>inosa</i>, the <i>angga</i> and
the <i>tanoana</i>. The <i>inosa</i> is the vital principle; it can be detected
in the veins and arteries; it is given to man by one of the great
natural phenomena, more especially the wind. The <i>angga</i> is the
intellectual part of man; its seat is unknown; after death it goes
to the under-world, and, unlike the <i>inosa</i>, which is believed to
be dissolved into its original elements, takes possession of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>150</span>
immaterial body. The <i>tanoana</i> is the divine in man and after death
returns to its lord, Poewempala boeroe. It goes forth during sleep,
and all that it sees it whispers into the sleeper&rsquo;s ear and then he
dreams. According to another account, the <i>tanoana</i> is the substance
by which man lives, thinks and acts; the <i>tanoana</i> of man,
plants and animals is of the same nature. A man&rsquo;s <i>tanoana</i> can be
strengthened by those of others; when the <i>tanoana</i> is long away or
destroyed the man dies. The <i>tanoana</i> seems to be the soul of which
lycanthropic feats are asserted.</p>

<p>Among the Toradjas of central Celebes it is believed that a man&rsquo;s
&ldquo;inside&rdquo; can take the form of a cat, wild pig, ape, deer or other
animal, and afterwards resume human form; it is termed <i>lamboyo</i>.
The exact relation of the <i>lamboyo</i> to the <i>tanoana</i> does not seem to be
settled; it will be seen below that the view seems to vary. According
to some the power of transformation is a gift of the gods, but others
hold that werwolfism is contagious and may be acquired by eating
food left by a werwolf or even by leaning one&rsquo;s head against the same
pillar. The Todjoers hold that any one who touches blood becomes
a werwolf. In accordance with this view is the belief that werwolfism
can be cured; the breast and stomach of the werman must
be rubbed and pinched, just as when any other witch object has to
be extracted. The patient drinks medicine, and the contagion leaves
the body in the form of snakes and worms. There are certain marks
by which a werman can be recognized. His eyes are unsteady and
sometimes green with dark shadows underneath. He does not sleep
soundly and fireflies come out of his mouth. His lips remain red in
spite of betel chewing, and he has a long tongue. The Todjoers add
that his hair stands on end.</p>

<p>Some of the forms of the <i>lamboyo</i> are distinguishable from ordinary
animals by the fact that they run about among the houses; the wer-buffalo
has only one horn, and the wer-pig transforms itself into an
ants&rsquo; nest, such as hangs from trees. Some say that the werman
does not really take the form of an animal himself, but, like the
sorcerer, only sends out a messenger. The <i>lamboyo</i> attacks by preference
solitary individuals, for he does not like to be observed. The
victim feels sleepy and loses consciousness; the <i>lamboyo</i> then assumes
human form (his body being, however, still at home) and cuts up his
victim, scattering the fragments all about. He then takes the liver
and eats it, puts the body together again, licks it with his long
tongue and joins it together. When the victim comes to himself
again he has no idea that anything unusual has happened to him.
He goes home, but soon begins to feel unwell. In a few days he dies,
but before his death he is able sometimes to name the werman to
whom he has fallen a victim.</p>

<p>From this account it might be inferred that the <i>lamboyo</i> was
identical with the <i>tanoana</i>; the absence of the <i>lamboyo</i> seems to
entail a condition of unconsciousness, and it can assume human
form. In other cases, however, the <i>lamboyo</i> seems to be analogous
to the familiar of the sorcerer. The Toradjas tell a story of how
a man once came to a house and asked the woman to give him a
rendezvous; it was night and she was asleep; the question was put
three times before the answer was given &ldquo;in the tobacco plantation.&rdquo;
The husband was awake, and next day followed his wife, who was
irresistibly drawn thither. The werman came to meet her in human
form, although his body was engaged in building a new house, and
caused the woman to faint by stamping three times on the ground.
Thereupon the husband attacked the werman with a piece of wood,
and the latter to escape transformed himself into a leaf; this the
husband put into a piece of bamboo and fastened the ends so that he
could not escape. He then went back to the village and put the
bamboo in the fire. The werman said &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and as soon as it
was burnt he fell dead.</p>

<p>In another case a woman died, and, as her death was believed to
be due to the malevolence of a werwolf, her husband watched by
her body. For, like Indian witches, the werwolf, for some reason,
wishes to revive his victim and comes in human form to carry off
the coffin. As soon as the woman was brought to life the husband
attacked the werwolf, who transformed himself into a piece of wood
and was burnt. The woman remained alive, but her murderer died
the same night.</p>

<p>According to a third form of the belief, the body of the werman
is itself transformed. One evening a man left the hut in which a
party were preparing to pass the night; one of his companions
heard a deer and fired into the darkness. Soon after the man came
back and said he had been shot. Although no marks were to be
seen he died a few days later.</p>

<p>In Central Java we meet with another kind of wer-tiger. The
power of transformation is regarded as due to inheritance, to the
use of spells, to fasting and will-power, to the use of charms, &amp;c.
Save when it is hungry or has just cause for revenge it is not hostile
to man; in fact, it is said to take its animal form only at night
and to guard the plantations from wild pigs, exactly as the <i>balams</i>
(magicians) of Yucatan were said to guard the corn fields in animal
form. Variants of this belief assert that the werman does not recognize
his friends unless they call him by name, or that he goes out as
a mendicant and transforms himself to take vengeance on those who
refuse him alms. Somewhat similar is the belief of the Khonds; for
them the tiger is friendly; he reserves his wrath for their enemies,
and a man is said to take the form of a tiger in order to wreak a just
vengeance.</p>

<p><i>Lycanthropy in South America.</i>&mdash;According to K. F. P. v. Martius
the <i>kanaima</i> is a human being who employs poison to carry out his
function of blood avenger; other authorities represent the <i>kanaima</i>
as a jaguar, which is either an avenger of blood or the familiar of a
cannibalistic sorcerer. The Europeans of Brazil hold that the
seventh child of the same sex in unbroken succession becomes a
wer-man or woman, and takes the form of a horse, goat, jaguar
or pig.</p>
</div>

<p>II. As a pathological state lycanthropy may be described
as a kind of hysteria, and may perhaps be brought into connexion
with the form of it known as <i>latah</i>. It is characterized
by the patient&rsquo;s belief that he has been metamorphosed into an
animal, and is often accompanied by a craving for strange
articles of food, including the flesh of living beings or of corpses.
In the lower stages of culture the state of the patient is commonly
explained as due to possession, but where he leaves the neighbourhood
of man real metamorphosis may be asserted, as in ordinary
lycanthropic beliefs. Marcellus of Sida says that in Greece the
patients frequented the tombs at night; they were recognizable
by their yellow complexion, hollow eyes and dry tongue. The
Garrows of India are said to tear their hair when they are seized
with the complaint, which is put down to the use of a drug
applied to the forehead; this recalls the stories of the witch&rsquo;s
salve in Europe. In Abyssinia the patient is usually a woman;
two forms are distinguished, caused by the hyena and the leopard
respectively. A kind of trance ushers in the fit; the fingers are
clenched, the eyes glazed and the nostrils distended; the patient,
when she comes to herself, laughs hideously and runs on all
fours. The exorcist is a blacksmith; as a rule, he applies onion
or garlic to her nose and proceeds to question the evil spirit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYCAON,<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> in Greek mythology, son of Pelasgus, the mythical
first king of Arcadia. He, or his fifty impious sons, entertained
Zeus and set before him a dish of human flesh; the god pushed
away the dish in disgust and either killed the king and his sons
by lightning or turned them into wolves (Apollodorus iii. 8;
Ovid, <i>Metam.</i> i. 198). Some say that Lycaon slew and dished
up his own son Nyctimus (Clem. Alex. <i>Protrept.</i> ii. 36; Nonnus,
<i>Dionys.</i> xviii. 20; Arnobius iv. 24). The deluge was said to
have been sent by Zeus in the time of Deucalion in consequence
of the sons&rsquo; impiety. Pausanias (viii. 2) says that Lycaon
sacrificed a child to Zeus on the altar on mount Lycaeus, and
immediately after the sacrifice was turned into a wolf. This
gave rise to the story that a man was turned into a wolf at each
annual sacrifice to Zeus Lycaeus, but recovered his human form
if he abstained from human flesh for ten years. The oldest
city, the oldest cultus (that of Zeus Lycaeus), and the first
civilization of Arcadia are attributed to Lycaon. His story
has been variously interpreted. According to Weizsäcker, he
was an old Pelasgian or pre-Hellenic god, to whom human
sacrifice was offered, bearing a non-Hellenic name similar to
<span class="grk" title="Lykos">&#955;&#973;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>, whence the story originated of his metamorphosis into a
wolf. His cult was driven out by that of the Hellenic Zeus, and
Lycaon himself was afterwards represented as an evil spirit,
who had insulted the new deity by setting human flesh before
him. Robertson Smith considers the sacrifices offered to the
wolf-Zeus in Arcadia to have been originally cannibal feasts of
a wolf-tribe, who recognized the wolf as their totem. Usener
and others identify Lycaon with Zeus Lycaeus, the god of light,
who slays his son Nyctimus (the dark) or is succeeded by him,
in allusion to the perpetual succession of night and day. According
to Ed. Meyer, the belief that Zeus Lycaeus accepted human
sacrifice in the form of a wolf was the origin of the myth that
Lycaon, the founder of his cult, became a wolf, <i>i.e.</i> participated
in the nature of the god by the act of sacrifice, as did all who
afterwards duly performed it. W. Mannhardt sees in the
ceremony an allusion to certain agricultural rites, the object of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>151</span>
which was to prevent the failure of the crops and to avert
pestilence (or to protect them and the flocks against the ravages
of wolves). Others (<i>e.g.</i> V. Bérard) take Zeus Lycaeus for a
Semitic Baal, whose worship was imported into Arcadia by the
Phoenicians; Immerwahr identifies him with Zeus Phyxios,
the god of the exile who flees on account of his having shed blood.
Another explanation is that the place of the sacred wolf once
worshipped in Arcadia was taken in cult by Zeus Lycaeus, and
in popular tradition by Lycaon, the ancestor of the Arcadians,
who was supposed to have been punished for his insulting treatment
of Zeus. It is possible that the whole may be merely a
reminiscence of a superstition similar to the familiar werwolf
stories.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYCAONIA,<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> in ancient geography, a large region in the
interior of Asia Minor, north of Mount Taurus. It was bounded
on the E. by Cappadocia, on the N. by Galatia, on the W. by
Phrygia and Pisidia, while to the S. it extended to the chain of
Mount Taurus, where it bordered on the country popularly
called in earlier times Cilicia Tracheia and in the Byzantine
period Isauria; but its boundaries varied greatly at different
times. The name is not found in Herodotus, but Lycaonia is
mentioned by Xenophon as traversed by Cyrus the younger on
his march through Asia. That author describes Iconium as
the last city of Phrygia; and in Acts xiv. 5 St Paul, after leaving
Iconium, crossed the frontier and came to Lystra in Lycaonia.
Ptolemy, on the other hand, includes Lycaonia as a part of the
province of Cappadocia, with which it was associated by the
Romans for administrative purposes; but the two countries
are clearly distinguished both by Strabo and Xenophon and by
authorities generally.</p>

<p>Lycaonia is described by Strabo as a cold region of elevated
plains, affording pasture to wild asses and to sheep; and at the
present day sheep abound, but asses are practically unknown.
Amyntas, king of Galatia, to whom the district was for a time
subject, maintained there not less than three hundred flocks.
It forms part of the interior tableland of Asia Minor, and has
an elevation of more than 3000 ft. It suffers from want of water,
aggravated in some parts by abundance of salt in the soil, so
that the northern portion, extending from near Iconium to the
salt lake of Tatta and the frontiers of Galatia, is almost wholly
barren, only small patches being cultivated near Iconium and
the large villages. The soil, where water is supplied, is productive.
In ancient times great attention was paid to storing and
distributing the water, so that much land now barren was
formerly cultivated and supported a large number of cities.</p>

<p>The plain is interrupted by some minor groups of mountains,
of volcanic character, of which the Kara Dagh in the south, a
few miles north of Karaman, rises above 7000 ft., while the
Karadja Dagh, north-east of it, though of inferior elevation,
presents a striking range of volcanic cones. The mountains in
the north-west, near Iconium and Laodicea, are the termination
of the Sultan Dagh range, which traverses a large part of Phrygia.</p>

<p>The Lycaonians appear to have been in early times to a great
extent independent of the Persian empire, and were like their
neighbours the Isaurians a wild and lawless race of freebooters;
but their country was traversed by one of the great natural lines
of high road through Asia Minor, from Sardis and Ephesus to the
Cilician gates, and a few considerable towns grew up along or
near this line. The most important was Iconium, in the most
fertile spot in the country, of which it was always regarded by
the Romans as the capital, although ethnologically it was
Phrygian. It is still called Konia, and it was the capital of the
Seljuk Turkish empire for several centuries. A little farther
north, immediately on the frontier of Phrygia, stood Laodicea
(Ladik), called Combusta, to distinguish it from the Phrygian
city of that name; and in the south, near the foot of Mount
Taurus, was Laranda, now called Karaman, which has given
name to the province of Karamania. Derbe and Lystra, which
appear from the Acts of the Apostles to have been considerable
towns, were between Iconium and Laranda. There were many
other towns, which became bishoprics in Byzantine times.
Lycaonia was Christianized very early; and its ecclesiastical
system was more completely organized in its final form during
the 4th century than that of any other region of Asia Minor.</p>

<p>After the defeat of Antiochus the Great, Lycaonia was given
by the Romans to Eumenes II., king of Pergamos. About 160
<span class="scs">B.C.</span> part of it, the &ldquo;Tetrarchy of Lycaonia,&rdquo; was added to
Galatia; and in 129 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the eastern half (usually called during
the following 200 years Lycaonia proper) was given to Cappadocia
as an eleventh strategia. In the readjustment of the
Provinciae, 64 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, by Pompey after the Mithradatic wars, he
gave the northern part of the tetrarchy to Galatia and the
eastern part of the eleventh strategia to Cappadocia. The remainder
was attached to Cilicia. Its administration and grouping
changed often under the Romans. In <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 371 Lycaonia was
first formed into a separate province. It now forms part of the
Konia viláyet.</p>

<p>The Lycaonians appear to have retained a distinct nationality
in the time of Strabo, but their ethnical affinities are unknown.
The mention of the Lycaonian language in the Acts of the
Apostles (xiv. 11) shows that the native language was spoken by
the common people at Lystra about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 50; and probably it
was only later and under Christian influence that Greek took its
place.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYCIA,<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> in ancient geography, a district in the S.W. of Asia
Minor, occupying the coast between Caria and Pamphylia, and
extending inland as far as the ridge of Mt Taurus. The region
thus designated is a peninsula projecting southward from the
great mountain masses of the interior. It is for the most part a
rugged mountainous country, traversed by offshoots of the
Taurus range, which terminate on the coast in lofty promontories.
The coast, though less irregular than that of Caria, is indented by
a succession of bays&mdash;the most marked of which is the Gulf of
Macri (anc. <i>Glaucus Sinus</i>) in the extreme west. A number of
smaller bays, and broken rocky headlands, with a few small
islets, constitute the coast-line thence to the S.E. promontory of
Lycia, formed by a long narrow tongue of rocky hill, known in
ancient times as the &ldquo;Sacred Promontory&rdquo; (Hiera Acra), with
three small adjacent islets, called the Chelidonian islands, which
was regarded by some ancient geographers as the commencement
of Mt. Taurus. Though the mountain ranges of Lycia are all
offshoots of Mt, Taurus, in ancient times several of them were
distinguished by separate names. Such were Daedala in the
west, adjoining the Gulf of Macri, Cragus on the sea-coast, west
of the valley of the Xanthus, Massicytus (10,000 ft.) nearly in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>152</span>
the centre of the region, and Solyma in the extreme east above
Phaselis (7800 ft.). The steep and rugged pass between Solyma
and the sea, called the Climax (&ldquo;Ladder&rdquo;), was the only direct
communication between Lycia and Pamphylia.</p>

<p>The only two considerable rivers are: (1) the Xanthus, which
descends from the central mass of Mt Taurus, and flows through
a narrow valley till it reaches the city of the same name, below
which it forms a plain of some extent before reaching the sea, and
(2) the Limyrus, which enters the sea near Limyra. The small
alluvial plains at the mouths of these rivers are the only level
ground in Lycia, but the hills that rise thence towards the
mountains are covered with a rich arborescent vegetation. The
upper valleys and mountain sides afford good pasture for sheep,
and the main Taurus range encloses several extensive upland
basin-shaped valleys (<i>vailas</i>), which are characteristic of that
range throughout its extent (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Asia Minor</a></span>).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The limits of Lycia towards the interior seem to have varied at
different times. The high and cold upland tract to the north-east,
called Milyas, was by some writers included in that province, though
it is naturally more connected with Pisidia. According to Artemidorus
(whose authority is followed by Strabo), the towns that
formed the Lycian league in the days of its integrity were
twenty-three in number; but Pliny states that Lycia once possessed seventy
towns, of which only twenty-six remained in his day. Recent researches
have fully confirmed the fact that the sea-coast and the
valleys were thickly studded with towns, many of which are proved
by existing remains to have been places of importance. By the aid
of inscriptions the position of the greater part of the cities mentioned
in ancient authors can be fixed. On the gulf of Glaucus, near the
frontiers of Caria, stood Telmessus, an important place, while a short
distance inland from it were the small towns of Daedala and Cadyanda.
At the entrance of the valley of the Xanthus were Patara,
Xanthus itself, and, a little higher up, Pinara on the west and Tlos
on the east side of the valley, while Araxa stood at the head of the
valley, at the foot of the pass leading into the interior. Myra, one
of the most important cities of Lycia, occupied the entrance of the
valley of the Andriacus; on the coast between this and the mouth
of the Xanthus stood Antiphellus, while in the interior at a short
distance were found Phellus, Cyaneae and Candyba. In the alluvial
plain formed by the rivers Arycandus and Limyrus stood Limyra,
and encircling the same bay the three small towns of Rhodiapolis,
Corydalla and Gagae. Arycanda commanded the upper valley of
the river of the same name. On the east coast stood Olympus, one
of the cities of the league, while Phaselis, a little farther north,
which was a much more important place, never belonged to the
Lycian league and appears always to have maintained an independent
position.</p>

<p>The cold upland district of the Milyas does not seem to have
contained any town of importance. Podalia appears to have been
its chief place. Between the Milyas and the Pamphylian Gulf was
the lofty mountain range of Solyma, which was supposed to derive
its name from the Solymi, a people mentioned by Homer in connexion
with the Lycians and the story of Bellerophon. In the flank
of this mountain, near a place called Deliktash, was the celebrated
fiery source called the Chimaera, which gave rise to many fables.
It has been visited in modern times by Captain F. Beaufort, T. A. B.
Spratt and Edward Forbes, and other travellers, and is merely a
stream of inflammable gas issuing from crevices in the rocks, such
as are found in several places in the Apennines. No traces of recent
volcanic action exist in Lycia.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;The name of the Lycians, <i>Lukki</i>, is first met with in
the Tel el-Amarna tablets (1400 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and in the list of the
nations from the eastern Mediterranean who invaded Egypt in
the reign of Mineptah, the successor of Rameses II. At that
time they seem to have occupied the Cilician coast. Their
occupation of Lycia was probably later, and since the Lycian
inscriptions are not found far inland, we may conclude that they
entered the country from the sea. On the other hand the name
appears to be preserved in Lycaonia, where some bands of them
may have settled. According to Herodotus they called themselves
Termilae, written Trmmile in the native inscriptions, and
he further states that the original inhabitants of the country
were the Milyans and Solymi, the Lycians being invaders from
Crete. In this tradition there is a reminiscence of the fact that
the Lycians had been sea-rovers before their settlement in Lycia.
The Lycian Sarpedon was believed to have taken part in the
Trojan war. The Lydians failed to subdue Lycia, but after the
fall of the Lydian empire it was conquered by Harpagus the
general of Cyrus, Xanthus or Arnna, the capital, being completely
destroyed. While acknowledging the suzerainty of
Persia, however, the Lycians remained practically independent,
and for a time joined the Delian league. &ldquo;The son of Harpagus&rdquo;
on the obelisk of Xanthus boasts of having sacked numerous
cities in alliance with the Athenian goddess. The Lycians were
incorporated into the empire of Alexander and his successors,
but even after their conquest by the Romans, preserved their
federal institutions as late as the time of Augustus. According
to Strabo the principal towns in the league were Xanthus,
Patara, Pinara, Olympus, Myra and Tlos; each of these had
three votes in the general assembly, while the other towns had
only two or one. Taxation and the appointment of the Lyciarch
and other magistrates were vested in the assembly. Under
Claudius Lycia was formally annexed to the Roman empire, and
united with Pamphylia: Theodosius made it a separate province.</p>

<p><i>Antiquities.</i>&mdash;Few parts of Asia Minor were less known in
modern times than Lycia up to the 19th century. Captain
Beaufort was the first to visit several places on the sea-coast,
and the remarkable rock-hewn tombs of Telmessus had been
already described by Dr Clarke, but it was Sir Charles Fellows
who first discovered and drew attention to the extraordinary richness
of the district in ancient remains, especially of a sepulchral
character. His visits to the country in 1838 and 1840 were
followed by an expedition sent by the British government in
1842 to transport to England the valuable monuments now in the
British Museum, while Admiral Spratt and Edward Forbes
explored the interior, and laid down its physical features on an
excellent map. The monuments thus brought to light are among
the most interesting of those discovered in Asia Minor, and prove
the existence of a distinct native architecture, especially in the
rock-cut tombs. But the theatres found in almost every town,
some of them of very large size, are sufficient to attest the pervading
influence of Greek civilization; and this is confirmed by
the sculptures, which are for the most part wholly Greek. None
of them, indeed, can be ascribed to a very early period, and hardly
any trace can be found of the influence of Assyrian or other
Oriental art.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting results of these recent researches
has been the discovery of numerous inscriptions in the native
language of the country, and written in an alphabet peculiar to
Lycia. A few of these inscriptions are bilingual, in Greek and
Lycian, and the clue thus afforded to their interpretation has been
followed up, first by Daniel Sharpe and Moritz Schmidt, and in
more recent years by J. Imbert, W. Arkwright, V. Thomsen,
A. Torp, S. Bugge and E. Kalinka.</p>

<p>The alphabet was derived from the Doric alphabet of Rhodes,
but ten other characters were added to it to express vocalic and
other sounds not found in Greek. The attempts to connect the
language with the Indo-European family have been unsuccessful;
it belongs to a separate family of speech which we may term
&ldquo;Asianic.&rdquo; Most of the inscriptions are sepulchral; by far the
longest and most important is that on an obelisk found at
Xanthus, which is a historical document, the concluding part of
it being in a peculiar dialect, supposed to be an older and poetical
form of the language. Among the deities mentioned are Trzzube
(Trosobis) and Trqqiz or Trqqas.</p>

<p>Lycian art was modelled on that of the Greeks. The rock-cut
tomb usually represented the house of the living, with an
elaborate façade, but in one or two instances, notably that of
the so-called Harpy-tomb, the façade is surmounted by a tall,
square tower, in the upper part of which is the sepulchral chamber.
Lycian sculpture followed closely the development of Greek
sculpture, and many of the sculptures with which the tombs are
adorned are of a high order of merit. The exquisite bas-reliefs
on a Lycian sarcophagus now in the museum of Constantinople
are among the finest surviving examples of classical art. The
bas-reliefs were usually coloured. For the coinage, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Numismatics</a></span>,

<p><span class="bold">LYCOPHRON,<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> Greek poet and grammarian, was born at
Chalcis in Euboea. He flourished at Alexandria in the time of
Ptolemy Philadelphus (285-247 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). According to Suïdas, he
was the son of Socles, but was adopted by Lycus of Rhegium.
He was entrusted by Ptolemy with the task of arranging the
comedies in the Alexandrian library, and as the result of his
labours composed a treatise <i>On Comedy</i>. His own compositions,
however, chiefly consisted of tragedies (Suïdas gives the titles
of twenty, of which very few fragments have been preserved),
which secured him a place in the Pleiad of Alexandrian tragedians.
One of his poems, <i>Alexandra</i> or <i>Cassandra</i>, containing 1474
iambic lines, has been preserved entire. It is in the form of a
prophecy uttered by Cassandra, and relates the later fortunes of
Troy and of the Greek and Trojan heroes. References to events
of mythical and later times are introduced, and the poem ends
with a reference to Alexander the Great, who was to unite Asia
and Europe in his world-wide empire. The style is so enigmatical
as to have procured for Lycophron, even among the ancients,
the title of &ldquo;obscure&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="skoteinos">&#963;&#954;&#959;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#962;</span>). The poem is evidently
intended to display the writer&rsquo;s knowledge of obscure names
and uncommon myths; it is full of unusual words of doubtful
meaning gathered from the older poets, and many long-winded
compounds coined by the author. It has none of the qualities
of poetry, and was probably written as a show-piece for the
Alexandrian school. It was very popular in the Byzantine
period, and was read and commented on very frequently; the
collection of scholia by Isaac and John Tzetzes is very valuable,
and the MSS. of the <i>Cassandra</i> are numerous.<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> A few well-turned
lines which have been preserved from Lycophron&rsquo;s tragedies
show a much better style; they are said to have been much
admired by Menedemus of Eretria, although the poet had
ridiculed him in a satyric drama. Lycophron is also said to have
been a skilful writer of anagrams.</p>

natural order of the Fern-allies (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pteridophyta</a></span>). They are
flowerless herbs, with an erect, prostrate or creeping widely-branched
stem, with small simple leaves which thickly cover
the stem and branches. The &ldquo;fertile&rdquo; leaves are arranged in
cones, and bear spore-cases (sporangia) in their axils, containing
spores of one kind only. The prothallium developed from the
spore is a subterranean mass of tissue of considerable size, and
bears the male and female organs (<i>antheridia</i> and <i>archegonia</i>).
There are about a hundred species widely distributed in temperate
and tropical climates; five occur in Britain on heaths and
moors, chiefly in mountainous districts, and are known as club-mosses
The commonest species, <i>L. clavatum</i>, is also known as
stag-horn moss.</p>

alcohol (90%), has been given, in doses of 15 to 60 minims, in cases of

<p class="noind">If this be so, he is probably to be connected with the cult of
Apollo Lycius or with that of Zeus Lycaeus. But the majority
of modern historians agree in accepting Lycurgus as an historical
person, however widely they may differ about his work.</p>

<p>According to the Spartan tradition preserved by Herodotus,
Lycurgus was a member of the Agiad house, son of Agis I. and
brother of Echestratus. On the death of the latter he became
regent and guardian of his nephew Labotas (Leobotes), who was
still a minor. Simonides, on the other hand, spoke of him as a
Eurypontid, son of Prytanis and brother of Eunomus, and later
the tradition prevailed which made him the son of Eunomus and
Dionassa, and half-brother of the king Polydectes, on whose
death he became guardian of the young king Charillus. According
to Herodotus he introduced his reforms immediately on
becoming regent, but the story which afterwards became generally
accepted and is elaborated by Plutarch represented him as
occupying for some time the position of regent, then spending
several years in travels, and on his return to Sparta carrying
through his legislation when Charillus was king. This latter
version helped to emphasize the disinterestedness of the lawgiver,
and also supplied a motive for his travels&mdash;the jealousy of those
who accused him of trying to supplant his nephew on the throne.
He is said to have visited Crete, Egypt and Ionia, and some
versions even took him to Spain, Libya and India.</p>

<p>Various beliefs were held as to the source from which Lycurgus
derived his ideas of reform. Herodotus found the tradition
current among the Spartans that they were suggested to Lycurgus
by the similar Cretan institutions, but even in the 5th century
there was a rival theory that he derived them from the Delphic
oracle. These two versions are united by Ephorus, who argued
that, though Lycurgus had really derived his system from Crete,
yet to give it a religious sanction he had persuaded the Delphic
priestess to express his views in oracular form.</p>

<p><i>The Reforms</i>.&mdash;Herodotus says that Lycurgus changed &ldquo;all
the customs,&rdquo; that he created the military organization of
<span class="grk" title="enômotiai">&#7952;&#957;&#969;&#956;&#959;&#964;&#943;&#945;&#953;</span> (<i>enomoties</i>), <span class="grk" title="triêkades">&#964;&#961;&#953;&#951;&#954;&#940;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span> (<i>triecades</i>) and <span class="grk" title="syssitia">&#963;&#965;&#963;&#963;&#943;&#964;&#953;&#945;</span> (<i>syssitia</i>),
and that he instituted the ephorate and the council of elders.
To him, further, are attributed the foundation of the apella
(the citizen assembly), the prohibition of gold and silver currency,
the partition of the land (<span class="grk" title="gês anadasmos">&#947;&#8134;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#948;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>) into equal lots, and, in
general, the characteristic Spartan training (<span class="grk" title="agôgê">&#7936;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#942;</span>). Some
of these statements are certainly false. The council of elders
and the assembly are not in any sense peculiar to Sparta, but are
present in the heroic government of Greece as depicted in the
Homeric poems. The ephors, again, are almost universally
held to be either an immemorial heritage of the Dorian stock or&mdash;and
this seems more probable&mdash;an addition to the Spartan constitution
made at a later date than can be assigned to Lycurgus.
Further, the tradition of the Lycurgan partition of the land is
open to grave objections. Grote pointed out (<i>History of Greece</i>,
pt. ii. ch. 6) that even from the earliest historical times we find
glaring inequalities of property at Sparta, and that the tradition
was apparently unknown to all the earlier Greek historians and
philosophers down to Plato and Aristotle: Isocrates (xii. 259)
expressly denied that a partition of land had ever taken place
in the Spartan state. Again, the tradition presupposes the
conquest by the Spartans of the whole, or at least the greater
part, of Laconia, yet Lycurgus must fall in the period when the
Spartans had not yet subjugated even the middle Eurotas plain,
in which their city lay. Finally, we can point to an adequate
explanation of the genesis of the tradition in the ideals of the
reformers of the latter part of the 3rd century, led by the kings
Agis IV. and Cleomenes III. (<i>q.v.</i>). To them the cause of Sparta&rsquo;s
decline lay in the marked inequalities of wealth, and they looked
upon a redistribution of the land as the reform most urgently
needed. But it was characteristic of the Greeks to represent
the ideals of the present as the facts of the past, and so such a
story as that of the Lycurgan <span class="grk" title="gês anadasmos">&#947;&#8134;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#948;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span> may well have arisen
at this time. It is at least noteworthy that the plan of Agis to
give 4500 lots to Spartans and 15,000 to perioeci suspiciously
resembles that of Lycurgus, in whose case the numbers are said
to have been 9000 and 30,000 respectively. Lastly, the prohibition
of gold and silver money cannot be attributed to Lycurgus,
for at so early a period coinage was yet unknown in Greece.</p>

<p>Lycurgus, then, did not create any of the main elements of the
Spartan constitution, though he may have regulated their
powers and defined their position. But tradition represented him
as finding Sparta the prey of disunion, weakness and lawlessness,
and leaving her united, strong and subject to the most stable
government which the Greek world had ever seen. Probably
Grote comes near to the truth when he says that Lycurgus
&ldquo;is the founder of a warlike brotherhood rather than the lawgiver
of a political community.&rdquo; To him we may attribute the
unification of the several component parts of the state, the strict
military organization and training which soon made the Spartan
hoplite the best soldier in Greece, and above all the elaborate
and rigid system of education which rested upon, and in turn
proved the strongest support of, that subordination of the
individual to the state which perhaps has had no parallel in the
history of the world.</p>

<p>Lycurgus&rsquo;s legislation is very variously dated, and it is not
possible either to harmonize the traditions or to decide with
confidence between them. B. Niese (<i>Hermes</i>, xlii. 440 sqq.) assigns
him to the first half of the 7th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Aristotle read
Lycurgus&rsquo;s name, together with that of Iphitus, on the discus
at Olympia which bore the terms of the sacred truce, but even
if the genuineness of the document and the identity of this
Lycurgus with the Spartan reformer be granted, it is uncertain
whether the discus belongs to the so-called first Olympiad,
776 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, or to an earlier date. Most traditions place Lycurgus in
the 9th century: Thucydides, whom Grote follows, dates his
reforms shortly before 804, Isocrates and Ephorus go back to 869,
and the chronographers are divided between 821, 828 and 834 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
Finally, according to a tradition recorded by Xenophon (<i>Resp.
Laced</i>. x. 8), he was contemporary with the Heraclidae, in which
case he would belong to the 10th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

a pupil both of Plato and of Isocrates. His early career is
unknown, but after the real character of the struggle with
Philip of Macedon became manifest he was recognized, with
Demosthenes and Hypereides, as one of the chiefs of the national
party. He left the care of external relations to his colleagues,
and devoted himself to internal organization and finance. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>155</span>
managed the finances of Athens for twelve successive years
(338-326), at first directly as treasurer of the revenues (<span class="grk" title="ho hepi tê

the actual office was forbidden him by law, through his son and
a nominal official chosen from his party. Part of one of the deeds
in which he rendered account of his term of office is still preserved
in an inscription. During this time he raised the public income
from 600 to 1200 talents yearly. He increased the navy, repaired
the dockyards, and completed an arsenal, the <span class="grk" title="skeuothêkê">&#963;&#954;&#949;&#965;&#959;&#952;&#942;&#954;&#951;</span>
designed by the architect Philo. He was also appointed to
various other offices connected with the preservation and improvement
of the city. He was very strict in his superintendence of the
public morals, and passed a sumptuary law to restrain extravagance.
He did much to beautify the city; he reconstructed
the great Dionysiac theatre and the gymnasium in the Lyceum,
and erected the Panathenaic stadium on the Ilissus. He is
mentioned as the proposer of five laws, of which the most famous
was that statues of the three great tragedians should be erected
in the theatre, and that their works should be carefully edited
and preserved among the state archives. For his services he was
honoured with crowns, statues and a seat in the town hall;
and after his death his friend Stratocles drew up a decree (still
extant in pseudo-Plutarch, <i>Vit. dec. orat.</i> p. 851; see also
E. L. Hicks, <i>Greek Historical Inscriptions</i>, 1st ed., No. 145),
ordering the erection of a statue of bronze to Lycurgus, and
granting the honours of the Prytaneum to his eldest son. He
was one of the orators whose surrender was demanded by
Alexander the Great, but the people refused to give him up.
He died while president of the theatre of Dionysus, and was
buried on the road leading to the Academy at the expense of the
state.</p>

<p>Lycurgus was a man of action; his orations, of which fifteen
were published, are criticized by the ancients for their awkward
arrangement, harshness of style, and the tendency to digressions
about mythology and history, although their noble spirit and
lofty morality are highly praised. The one extant example,
<i>Against Leocrates</i>, fully bears out this criticism. After the
battle of Chaeroneia (338), in spite of the decree which forbade
emigration under pain of death, Leocrates had fled from Athens.
On his return (probably about 332) he was impeached by
Lycurgus, but acquitted, the votes of the judges being equally
divided.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYCURGUS,<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span> &ldquo;<span class="sc">the Logothete</span>&rdquo; (1772-1851), Greek leader in
the War of Independence, was born in the island of Samos. He
was educated at Constantinople, received the usual training, and
followed the customary career of a Phanariot Greek. He
accompanied Constantine Ypsilanti when he was appointed
hospodar of Walachia, as secretary, and served Ypsilanti&rsquo;s
successor, Alexander Soutzos, as treasurer and chancellor
(Logothete). In 1802 he returned to Samos, and having become
suspected by the Turkish government was imprisoned. He fled
to Smyrna, when he was pardoned and released by the Turks.
When the War of Independence began he induced his countrymen
to declare Samos independent, and was chosen ruler. His
share in the War of Independence is chiefly memorable because
he provoked the massacre of Chios in 1822. Lycurgus conducted
an expedition of 2500 to that island, which was held
by a Turkish garrison under Velna Pasha. His force was insufficient,
the time was ill-chosen, for a strong Turkish fleet was
at sea, and Lycurgus displayed utter incapacity as a military
leader. After these events, he was deposed by the Samians,
but recovered some influence and had a share in the defence of
Samos against the Turks in 1824. When the island was left
under the authority of Turkey by the protocol of the 3rd of
February 1830, he helped to obtain autonomy for the Samians.
He retired to Greece and died on the 22nd of May 1851.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYDD,<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> a market town and municipal borough in the southern
parliamentary division of Kent, England, 71½ m. S.E. by E.
of London by a branch of the South-Eastern &amp; Chatham
railway. Pop. (1901) 2675. It lies in the open lowland of
Dunge Marsh. To the south-east are the bare shingle banks
of the promontory of Dungeness. Its church of All Saints has
a beautiful Perpendicular tower with rich vaulting within.
The neighbourhood affords pasture for large flocks of sheep.
On the land known as the Rypes, in the neighbourhood, there
is a military camp, with artillery and rifle ranges; hence the
name given to the explosive &ldquo;lyddite.&rdquo; The town is governed
by a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors. Area, 12,043
acres.</p>

<p>The first settlement at Lydd (Hlide, Lide, Lyde) was probably
due to its convenience as a fishing-station. After the Conquest
it became a seaport of some consequence and although now,
owing to the alteration of the coast, it stands nearly 3 m. inland
a number of its inhabitants are still fishermen. In 774 land in
Lydd was granted by Offa to the monks of Christ Church,
Canterbury, and the archbishop of Canterbury evidently held
the lordship of the town from an early date. At some time
before the reign of Edward I. Lydd was made a member of the
Cinque Port of Romney, and in 1290 was granted the same
liberties and free customs as the Cinque Ports on condition of
aiding the service of its head-port to the crown with one ship.
This charter was confirmed by Edward III. in 1365. The
corporation also possesses documents of 1154, 1399 and 1413,
granting to the archbishop&rsquo;s men of Lydd the privileges enjoyed
by the Cinque Ports and confirming all former privileges. Lydd
is called a borough in the Hundred Rolls. Its incorporation
under a bailiff, of which there is evidence in the 15th century,
may have been due to the archbishop or to the court of Shepway,
but it was not incorporated by the crown until 1885, when, by a
charter under the Municipal Acts, the last bailiff was elected
the first mayor. In 1494 a grant was made to the bailiff, jurats
and commonalty of a yearly fair on the 12th of July and two
days following. A fair was held under this grant until 1874.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYDENBURG,<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span> a town and district of the Transvaal, South
Africa. The town is 60 m. by rail N.N.E. of Belfast on the
Pretoria-Delagoa Bay railway. Pop. (1904) 1523. It is picturesquely
situated on the Spekboom tributary of the Olifants
river at an altitude of 4900 ft. Some 15 m. E. is the Mauchberg
(8725 ft.), the highest point in the Transvaal. The town is the
chief centre for the Lydenburg goldfields. Next to Lydenburg
the most important settlement in these goldfields is Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Rest, pop. (1904) 1188, 23 m. N.E. of Lydenburg. Lydenburg
(the town of suffering) was founded in 1846 by Boers who two
years previously had established themselves farther north at
Ohrigstad, which they abandoned on account of the fever
endemic there. Lydenburg at once became the capital of a
district (of the same name) which then embraced all the eastern
part of the Transvaal. In 1856 the Boers of Lydenburg separated
from their brethren and proclaimed an independent republic,
which was, however, incorporated with the South African
Republic in 1860. The discovery of gold near the town was
made in 1869, and in 1873 the first successful goldfield in the
Transvaal was opened here. It was not until 1910, however,
that Lydenburg was placed in railway communication with the
rest of the country. The present district of Lydenburg consists
of the north-east and central parts of the original district. In
the Lulu Mountains, a spur of the Drakensberg, and some 40 m.
N.W. of Lydenburg, was the stronghold of the Kaffir chief
Sikukuni, whose conflict with the Boers in 1876 was one of the
causes which led to the annexation of the Transvaal by Great
Britain in 1877. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Transvaal</a></span>: <i>History</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYDFORD,<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Lidford</span>, a village, once an important town,
in the western parliamentary division of Devonshire, England,
near the western confines of Dartmoor, 27 m. N. of Plymouth
by the London &amp; South-Western railway. From its Perpendicular
church of St Petrock fine views of the Dartmoor tors are
seen. The village stands on the small river Lyd, which traverses
a deep narrow chasm, crossed by a bridge of single span; and at
a little distance a tributary stream forms a cascade in an exquisite
glen. Close to the church are slight remains of the castle of
Lydford.</p>

<p>Lydford (<i>Lideford</i>) was one of the four Saxon boroughs of
Devon, and possessed a mint in the days of Æthelred the Unready.
It first appears in recorded history in 997, when the Danes
made a plundering expedition up the Tamar and Tavy as far
as &ldquo;Hlidaforda.&rdquo; In the reign of Edward the Confessor it
was the most populous centre in Devonshire after Exeter, but
the Domesday Survey relates that forty houses had been laid
waste since the Conquest, and the town never recovered its
former prosperity; the history from the 13th century centres
round the castle, which is first mentioned in 1216, when it was
granted to William Briwere, and was shortly afterwards fixed
as the prison of the stannaries and the meeting-place of the
Forest Courts of Dartmoor. A gild at Lideford is mentioned
in 1180, and the pipe roll of 1195 records a grant for the reestablishment
of the market. In 1238 the borough, which had
hitherto been crown demesne, was bestowed by Henry III.
on Richard, earl of Cornwall, who in 1268 obtained a grant of a
Wednesday market and a three days&rsquo; fair at the feast of St
Petrock. The borough had a separate coroner and bailiff in
1275, but it was never incorporated by charter, and only once,
in 1300, returned members to parliament. Lydford prison is
described in 1512 as &ldquo;one of the most hainous, contagious and
detestable places in the realm,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lydford Law&rdquo; was a
by-word for injustice. At the time of the Commonwealth the
castle was entirely in ruins, but in the 18th century it was
restored and again used as a prison and as the meeting-place
of the manor and borough courts.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LYDGATE, JOHN<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> (<i>c</i>. 1370-<i>c</i>. 1451), English poet, was born at
the village of Lydgate, some 6 or 7 m. from Newmarket. It is,
however, with the Benedictine abbey of Bury St Edmunds
that he is chiefly associated. Probably he was educated at the
school attached to the monastery, and in his <i>Testament</i> he has
drawn a lively picture of himself as a typical orchard-robbing
boy, who had scant relish for matins, fought, and threw creed
and paternoster at the cock. He was ordained sub-deacon in
1389, deacon in 1393, and priest in 1397. These dates are valuable
as enabling us to fix approximately the date of his birth, which
must have occurred somewhere about 1370. Lydgate passed
as a portent of learning, and, according to Bale, he pursued his
studies not only at both the English universities but in France
and Italy. Koeppel (see <i>Laurents de Premierfait und John
Lydgates Bearbeitungen von Boccaccios De Casibus</i>, Munich, 1885)
has thrown much doubt on this statement as regards Italy, but
Lydgate knew France and visited Paris in an official capacity
in 1426. Bale is also the authority for another assertion that
figures in what has been aptly termed the poet&rsquo;s &ldquo;traditional
biography,&rdquo; viz. that Lydgate, on completing his own education,
kept school for the sons of noblemen and gentlemen. This
&ldquo;traditional biography&rdquo; prolongs his life to the year 1461,
but it is quite improbable that he lived many years after 1446,
when Abbot Curteys died and John Baret, treasurer of Bury,
signed an extant receipt for a pension which he shared with
Lydgate, and which continued to be paid till 1449. If it be true,
as Bishop Alcock of Ely affirms, that Lydgate wrote a poem on
the loss of France and Gascony, it seems necessary to suppose
that he lived two years longer, and thus indications point to the
year 1451, or thereabouts, as the date of his death.</p>

<p>Lydgate had a consuming passion for literature, and it was
probably that he might indulge this taste more fully that in
1434 he retired from the priorate of Hatfield Broadoak (or
Hatfield Regis), to which he had been appointed in June 1423.
After 1390&mdash;but whilst he was still a young man&mdash;he made the
acquaintance of Geoffrey Chaucer, with whose son Thomas
he was on terms of considerable intimacy. This friendship
appears to have decided Lydgate&rsquo;s career, and in his <i>Troy-book</i>
and elsewhere are reverent and touching tributes to his &ldquo;master.&rdquo;
The passages in question do not exaggerate his obligations to
the &ldquo;well of English.&rdquo; The themes of all his more ambitious
poems can be traced to Chaucerian sources. <i>The Story of
Thebes</i>, for instance, was doubtless suggested by the &ldquo;romance&rdquo;
which Cressida and her companions are represented as reading
when interrupted by Pandarus (<i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, II. xii.-xvi.).
The <i>Falls of Princes</i>, again, is merely the <i>Monk&rsquo;s Tale</i> &ldquo;writ
large.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydgate is a most voluminous writer. The <i>Falls of Princes</i>
alone comprises 7000 stanzas; and his authentic compositions
reach the enormous total of 150,000 lines. Cursed with such
immoderate fluency Lydgate could not sustain himself at the
highest level of artistic excellence; and, though imbued with a
sense of the essentials of poetry, and eager to prove himself in
its various manifestations, he stinted himself of the self-discipline
necessary to perfection of form. As the result the bulk of his
composition is wholly or comparatively rough-hewn. That he
was capable of better work than is suggested by his average
accomplishment is shown by two allegorical poems&mdash;the
<i>Complaint of the Black Knight</i> and the <i>Temple of Glass</i> (once
attributed to Hawes). In these he reveals himself as a not
unworthy successor of Chaucer, and the pity of it is that he should
have squandered his powers in a futile attempt to create an
entire literature. For a couple of centuries Lydgate&rsquo;s reputation
equalled, if it did not surpass, that of his master. This was in
a sense only natural, since he was the real founder of the school
of which Stephen Hawes was a distinguished ornament, and
which &ldquo;held the field&rdquo; in English letters during the long and
dreary interval between Chaucer and Spenser. One of the most
obvious defects of this school is excessive attachment to polysyllabic
terms. Lydgate is not quite so great a sinner in this
respect as are some of his successors, but his tendency cannot
be mistaken, and John Metham is amply justified in his censure&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>Eke John Lydgate, sometime monk of Bury,</p>
<p>His books indited with terms of rhetoric</p>

</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">Pedantry was an inevitable effect of the early Renaissance.
French literature passed through the same phase, from which
indeed it was later in emerging; and the ultimate consequence
was the enrichment of both languages. It must be conceded
as no small merit in Lydgate that, in an age of experiment
he should have succeeded so often in hitting the right word.
Thomas Warton remarks on his lucidity. Since his writings are
read more easily than Chaucer&rsquo;s, the inference is plain&mdash;that he
was more effectual as a maker of our present English. In spite
of that, Lydgate is characteristically medieval&mdash;medieval in his
prolixity, his platitude, his want of judgment and his want of
taste; medieval also in his pessimism, his Mariolatry and his
horror of death. These attributes jarred on the sensitive Ritson,
who racked his brains for contumelious epithets such as &ldquo;stupid
and disgusting,&rdquo; &ldquo;cart-loads of rubbish,&rdquo; &amp;c.; and during the
greater part of the 18th and 19th centuries Lydgate&rsquo;s reputation
was at its lowest ebb. Recent criticism has been far more
impartial, and almost too much respect has been paid to his
attainments, especially in the matter of metre, though Lydgate
himself, with offensive lightheartedness, admits his poor craftsmanship.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lydgate&rsquo;s most doughty and learned apologist is Dr Schick, whose
preface to the <i>Temple of Glass</i> embodies practically all that is known
or conjectured concerning this author, including the chronological
order of his works. With the exception of the <i>Damage and Destruction
in Realms</i>&mdash;an account of Julius Caesar, his wars and his death&mdash;they
are all in verse and extremely multifarious&mdash;narrative, devotional
hagiological, philosophical and scientific, allegorical and
moral, historical, satirical and occasional. The <i>Troy-book</i>, undertaken
at the command of Henry V., then prince of Wales, dates from
1412-1420; the <i>Story of Thebes</i> from 1420-1422; and the <i>Falls of
Princes</i> towards 1430. His latest work was <i>Secreta Secretorum</i> or
<i>Secrets of Old Philosophers</i>, rhymed extracts from a pseudo-Aristotelian
treatise. Lydgate certainly possessed extraordinary versatility,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>157</span>
which enabled him to turn from elaborate epics to quite popular
poems like the <i>Mumming at Hertford</i>, <i>A Ditty of Women&rsquo;s Horns</i> and
<i>London Lickpenny</i>. The humour of this last is especially bright and
effective, but, unluckily for the author, the piece is believed to have
been retouched by some other hand. The longer efforts partake of
the nature of translations from sundry medieval compilations like
those of Guido di Colonna and Boccaccio, which are in Latin.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYDIA,<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> in ancient geography, a district of Asia Minor, the
boundaries of which it is difficult to fix, partly because they
varied at different epochs. The name is first found under the
form of <i>Luddi</i> in the inscriptions of the Assyrian king Assur-bani-pal,
who received tribute from Gyges about 660 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> In
Homer we read only of Maeonians (<i>Il</i>. ii. 865, v. 43, x. 431), and
the place of the Lydian capital Sardis is taken by Hyd&#275; (<i>Il</i>. xx.
385), unless this was the name of the district in which Sardis
stood (see Strabo xiii. p. 626).<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The earliest Greek writer who
mentions the name is Mimnermus of Colophon, in the 37th
Olympiad. According to Herodotus (i. 7), the Meiones (called
Maeones by other writers) were named Lydians after Lydus, the
son of Attis, in the mythical epoch which preceded the rise of the
Heraclid dynasty. In historical times the Maeones were a tribe
inhabiting the district of the upper Hermus, where a town called
Maeonia existed (Pliny, <i>N.H.</i> v. 30; Hierocles, p. 670). The
Lydians must originally have been an allied tribe which bordered
upon them to the north-west, and occupied the plain of Sardis or
Magnesia at the foot of Tmolus and Sipylus. They were cut off
from the sea by the Greeks, who were in possession, not only of the
Bay of Smyrna, but also of the country north of Sipylus as far as
Temnus in the pass (<i>boghaz</i>), through which the Hermus forces its
way from the plain of Magnesia into its lower valley.<a name="fa2h" id="fa2h" href="#ft2h"><span class="sp">2</span></a> In a
Homeric epigram the ridge north of the Hermus, on which the
ruins of Temnus lie, is called Sarden&#275;. Northward the Lydians
extended at least as far as the Gygaean Lake (Lake Coloe, mod.
Mermereh), and the Sarden&#275; range (mod. Dumanli Dagh). The
plateau of the Bin Bir Tep&#275;, on the southern shore of the Gygaean
Lake, was the chief burial-place of the inhabitants of Sardis, and
is still thickly studded with tumuli, among which is the &ldquo;tomb
of Alyattes&rdquo; (260 ft. high). Next to Sardis the chief city was
Magnesia ad Sipylum (<i>q.v.</i>), in the neighbourhood of which is the
famous seated figure of &ldquo;Niobe&rdquo; (<i>Il</i>. xxiv. 614-617), cut out of the
rock, and probably intended to represent the goddess Cybele, to
which the Greeks attached their legend of Niobe. According to
Pliny (v. 31), Tantalis, afterwards swallowed up by earthquake
in the pool Sal&#275; or Salo&#275;, was the ancient name of Sipylus and
&ldquo;the capital of Maeonia&rdquo; (Paus. vii. 24; Strabo xii. 579).
Under the Heraclid dynasty the limits of Lydia must have been
already extended, since according to Strabo (xiii. 590), the
authority of Gyges reached as far as the Troad. Under the
Mermnads Lydia became a maritime as well as an inland power.
The Greek cities were conquered, and the coast of Ionia included
within the Lydian kingdom. The successes of Alyattes and of
Croesus finally changed the Lydian kingdom into a Lydian empire,
and all Asia Minor westward of the Halys, except Lycia, owned
the supremacy of Sardis. Lydia never again shrank back into
its original dimensions. After the Persian conquest the Maeander
was regarded as its southern boundary, and in the Roman
period it comprised the country between Mysia and Caria on the
one side and Phrygia and the Aegean on the other.</p>

<p>Lydia proper was exceedingly fertile. The hill-sides were
clothed with vine and fir, and the rich broad plain of Hermus
produced large quantities of corn and saffron. The climate of
the plain was soft but healthy, though the country was subject
to frequent earthquakes. The Pactolus, which flowed from the
fountain of Tarn&#275; in the Tmolus mountains, through the centre
of Sardis, into the Hermus, was believed to be full of golden sand;
and gold mines were worked in Tmolus itself, though by the time
of Strabo the proceeds had become so small as hardly to pay for
the expense of working them (Strabo xiii. 591). Maeonia on the
east contained the curious barren plateau known to the Greeks as
the Katakekaumen&#275; (&ldquo;Burnt country&rdquo;), once a centre of volcanic
disturbance. The Gygaean lake (where remains of pile dwellings
have been found) still abounds with carp.</p>

<p>Herodotus (i. 171) tells us that Lydus was a brother of Mysus
and Car. The statement is on the whole borne out by the few
Lydian, Mysian and Carian words that have been preserved, as
well as by the general character of the civilization prevailing
among the three nations. The race was probably a mixed one,
consisting of aborigines and Aryan immigrants. It was characterized
by industry and a commercial spirit, and, before the Persian
conquest, by bravery. The religion of the Lydians resembled
that of the other civilized nations of Asia Minor. It was a nature
worship, which at times became wild and sensuous. By the side
of the supreme god Medeus stood the sun-god Attis, as in Phrygia
the chief object of the popular cult. He was at once the son and
bridegroom of Cybele (<i>q.v.</i>) or Cybebe, the mother of the gods,
whose image carved by Broteas, son of Tantalus, was adored
on the cliffs of Sipylus (Paus. iii. 22). The cult may have been
brought westward by the Hittites who have left memorials of
themselves in the pseudo-Sesostris figures of Kara-bel (between
Sardis and Ephesus) as well as in the figure of the Mother-goddess,
the so-called Niobe. At Ephesus, where she was adored
under the form of a meteoric stone, she was identified with the
Greek Artemis (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Great Mother of the Gods</a></span>). Her
mural crown is first seen in the Hittite sculptures of Boghaz
Keui (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pteria</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hittites</a></span>) on the Halys. The priestesses
by whom she was served are depicted in early art as armed with
the double-headed axe, and the dances they performed in her
honour with shield and bow gave rise to the myths which saw in
them the Amazons, a nation of woman-warriors. The pre-Hellenic
cities of the coast&mdash;Smyrna, Samorna (Ephesus),
Myrina, Cyme, Priene and Pitane&mdash;were all of Amazonian origin,
and the first three of them have the same name as the Amazon
Myrina, whose tomb was pointed out in the Troad. The prostitution
whereby the Lydian girls gained their dowries (Herod, i.
93) was a religious exercise, as among the Semites, which marked
their devotion to the goddess Cybele. In the legend of Heracles,
Omphale takes the place of Cybele, and was perhaps her Lydian
title. Heracles is here the sun-god Attis in a new form; his
Lydian name is unknown, since E. Meyer has shown (<i>Zeitschr. d.
Morg. Gesell.</i> xxxi. 4) that Sandon belongs not to Lydia but to
Cilicia. By the side of Attis stood Manes or Men, identified later
with the Moon-god.</p>

<p>According to the native historian Xanthus (460 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) three
dynasties ruled in succession over Lydia. The first, that of the
Attiads, is mythical. It was headed by a god, and included
geographical personages like Lydus, Asies and Meies, or such
heroes of folk-lore as Cambletes, who devoured his wife. To this
mythical age belongs the colony which, according to Herodotus
(i. 94), Tyrsenus, the son of Attis, led to Etruria. Xanthus,
however, puts Torrhebus in the place of Tyrsenus, and makes
him the eponym of a district in Lydia. It is doubtful whether
Xanthus recognized the Greek legends which brought Pelops
from Lydia, or rather Maeonia, and made him the son of Tantalus.
The second dynasty was also of divine origin, but the names
which head it prove its connexion with the distant East. Its
founder, a descendant of Heracles and Omphale, was, Herodotus
tells us (i. 7), a son of Ninus and grandson of Belus. The Assyrian
inscriptions have shown that the Assyrians had never crossed the
Halys, much less known the name of Lydia, before the age of
Assur-bani-pal, and consequently the theory which brought the
Heraclids from Nineveh must be given up. But the Hittites,
another Oriental people, deeply imbued with the elements of
Babylonian culture, had overrun Asia Minor and established
themselves on the shores of the Aegean before the reign of the
Egyptian king Rameses II.</p>

<p>The subject allies who then fight under their banners include
the Masu or Mysians and the Dardani of the Troad, while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span>
Hittites have left memorials in Lydia. G. Dennis discovered an
inscription in Hittite hieroglyphics attached to the figure of
&ldquo;Niobe&rdquo; on Sipylus, and a similar inscription accompanies the
figure (in which Herodotus, ii. 106, wished to see Sesostris or
Rameses II.) in the pass of Karabel. We learn from Eusebius
that Sardis was first captured by the Cimmerii 1078 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; and
since it was four centuries later before the real Cimmerii (<i>q.v.</i>)
appeared on the horizon of history, we may perhaps find in the
statement a tradition of the Hittite conquest. As the authority
of the Hittite satraps at Sardis began to decay the Heraclid
dynasty arose. According to Xanthus, Sadyattes and Lixus were
the successors of Tylon the son of Omphale. After lasting five
hundred and five years, the dynasty came to an end in the person
of Sadyattes, as he is called by Nicolas of Damascus, whose
account is doubtless derived from Xanthus. The name Candaules,
given him by Herodotus, meant &ldquo;dog strangler&rdquo; and
was a title of the Lydian Hermes. Gyges (<i>q.v.</i>) put him to death
and established the dynasty of the Mermnads, 687 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Gyges
initiated a new policy, that of making Lydia a maritime power;
but towards the middle of his reign the kingdom was overrun
by the Cimmerii. The lower town of Sardis was taken, and Gyges
sent tribute to Assur-bani-pal, as well as two Cimmerian chieftains
he had himself captured in battle. A few years later
Gyges joined in the revolt against Assyria, and the Ionic and
Carian mercenaries he despatched to Egypt enabled Psammetichus
to make himself independent. Assyria, however, was
soon avenged. The Cimmerian hordes returned, Gyges was
slain in battle (652 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and Ardys his son and successor returned
to his allegiance to Nineveh. The second capture of Sardis on
this occasion was alluded to by Callisthenes (Strabo xiii. 627).
Alyattes, the grandson of Ardys, finally succeeded in extirpating
the Cimmerii, as well as in taking Smyrna, and thus providing
his kingdom with a port. The trade and wealth of Lydia rapidly
increased, and the Greek towns fell one after the other before the
attacks of the Lydian kings. Alyattes&rsquo;s long reign of fifty-seven
years saw the foundation of the Lydian empire. All Asia Minor
west of the Halys acknowledged his sway, and the six years&rsquo;
contest he carried on with the Medes was closed by the marriage
of his daughter Aryenis to Astyages. The Greek cities were
allowed to retain their own institutions and government on condition
of paying taxes and dues to the Lydian monarch, and
the proceeds of their commerce thus flowed into the imperial
exchequer. The result was that the king of Lydia became the
richest prince of his age. Alyattes was succeeded by Croesus
(<i>q.v.</i>), who had probably already for some years shared the royal
power with his father, or perhaps grandfather, as V. Floigl thinks
(<i>Geschichte des semitischen Alterthums</i>, p. 20). He reigned alone
only fifteen years, Cyrus the Persian, after an indecisive battle
on the Halys, marching upon Sardis, and capturing both acropolis
and monarch (546 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). The place where the acropolis was
entered was believed to have been overlooked by the mythical
Meles when he carried the lion round his fortress to make it
invulnerable; it was really a path opened by one of the landslips,
which have reduced the sandstone cliff of the acropolis to a mere
shell, and threaten to carry it altogether into the plain below.
The revolt of the Lydians under Pactyas, whom Cyrus had
appointed to collect the taxes, caused the Persian king to disarm
them, though we can hardly credit the statement that by this
measure their warlike spirit was crushed. Sardis now became
the western capital of the Persian empire, and its burning by
the Athenians was the indirect cause of the Persian War. After
Alexander the Great&rsquo;s death, Lydia passed to Antigonus; then
Achaeus made himself king at Sardis, but was defeated and put
to death by Antiochus. The country was presented by the
Romans to Eumenes, and subsequently formed part of the
proconsular province of Asia. By the time of Strabo (xiii.
631) its old language was entirely supplanted by Greek.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Lydian empire may be described as the industrial power
of the ancient world. The Lydians were credited with being the
inventors, not only of games such as dice, huckle-bones and ball
(Herod, i. 94), but also of coined money. The oldest known coins are
the electrum coins of the earlier Mermnads (Madden, <i>Coins of the
Jews</i>, pp. 19-21), stamped on one side with a lion&rsquo;s head or the
figure of a king with bow and quiver; these were replaced by Croesus
with a coinage of pure gold and silver. To the latter monarch were
probably due the earliest gold coins of Ephesus (Head, <i>Coinage of
Ephesus</i>, p. 16). The electrum coins of Lydia were of two kinds, one
weighing 168.4 grains for the inland trade, and another of 224 grains
for the trade with Ionia. The standard was the silver mina of
Carchemish (as the Assyrians called it) which contained 8656 grains.
Originally derived by the Hittites from Babylonia, but modified by
themselves, this standard was passed on to the nations of Asia
Minor during the period of Hittite conquest, but was eventually
superseded by the Phoenician mina of 11,225 grains, and continued
to survive only in Cyprus and Cilicia (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Numismatics</a></span>). The
inns, which the Lydians were said to have been the first to establish
(Herod. i. 94), were connected with their attention to commercial
pursuits. Their literature has wholly perished. They were celebrated
for their music and gymnastic exercises, and their art formed
a link between that of Asia Minor and that of Greece. R. Heberdey&rsquo;s
excavations at Ephesus since 1896, like those of D. G. Hogarth in 1905,
belong to the history of Greek and not native art. The ivory figures,
however, found by Hogarth on the level of the earliest temple of
Artemis show Asiatic influence, and resemble the so-called &ldquo;Phoenician&rdquo;
ivories from the palace of Sargon at Calah (Nimrud). For a
description of a pectoral of white gold, ornamented with the heads of
animals, human faces and the figure of a goddess, discovered in a
tomb on Tmolus, see <i>Academy</i>, January 15, 1881, p. 45. Lydian
sculpture was probably similar to that of the Phrygians. Phallic
emblems, for averting evil, were plentiful; the summit of the tomb
of Alyattes is crowned with an enormous one of stone, about 9 ft. in
diameter. The tumulus itself is 281 yds. in diameter and about half
a mile in circumference. It has been partially excavated by G.
Spiegelthal and G. Dennis, and a sepulchral chamber discovered in
the middle, composed of large well-cut and highly polished blocks of
marble, the chamber being 11 ft. long, nearly 8 ft. broad and 7 ft.
high. Nothing was found in it except a few ashes and a broken vase
of Egyptian alabaster. The stone basement which, according to
Herodotus, formerly surrounded the mound has disappeared.</p>

writer on antiquarian subjects, was born at Philadelphia
in Lydia about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 490. At an early age he set out to seek his
fortune in Constantinople, and held high court and state offices
under Anastasius and Justinian. In 552 he lost favour, and was
dismissed. The date of his death is not known, but he was
probably alive during the early years of Justin II. (reigned 565-578).
During his retirement he occupied himself in the compilation
of works on the antiquities of Rome, three of which have
been preserved: (1) <i>De Ostentis</i> (<span class="grk" title="Peri diosêmeiôn">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#948;&#953;&#959;&#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#8182;&#957;</span>), on the origin
and progress of the art of divination; (2) <i>De Magistratibus
reipublicae Romanae</i> (<span class="grk" title="Peri archôn tês Rhômaiôn politeias">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#8172;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#943;&#969;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span>),
especially valuable for the administrative details of the time of

festivals of the year. The chief value of these books consists
in the fact that the author made use of the works (now lost) of
old Roman writers on similar subjects. Lydus was also commissioned
by Justinian to compose a panegyric on the emperor,
and a history of his successful campaign against Persia; but
these, as well as some poetical compositions, are lost.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYELL, SIR CHARLES<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> (1797-1875), British geologist, was
the eldest son of Charles Lyell of Kinnordy, Forfarshire, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>159</span>
was born on the 14th of November 1797, on the family estate in
Scotland. His father (1767-1849) was known both as a botanist
and as the translator of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> and the <i>Convito</i> of Dante:
the plant <i>Lyellia</i> was named after him. From his boyhood Lyell
had a strong inclination for natural history, especially entomology,
a taste which he cultivated at Bartley Lodge in the New
Forest, to which his family had removed soon after his birth.
In 1816 he entered Exeter College, Oxford, where the lectures
of Dr Buckland first drew his attention to geological study.
After taking his degree of B.A. in 1819 (M.A. in 1821) he entered
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, and in 1825, after a delay caused by chronic
weakness of the eyes, he was called to the bar, and went on the
western circuit for two years. During this time he was slowly
gravitating towards the life of a student of science. In 1819 he
had been elected a fellow of the Linnean and Geological Societies,
communicating his first paper, &ldquo;On a Recent Formation of Freshwater
Limestone in Forfarshire,&rdquo; to the latter society in 1822,
and acting as one of the honorary secretaries in 1823. In that
year he went to France, with introductions to Cuvier, Humboldt
and other men of science, and in 1824 made a geological
tour in Scotland in company with Dr Buckland. In 1826 he
was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, from which in later
years he received both the Copley and Royal medals; and in
1827 he finally abandoned the legal profession, and devoted
himself to geology.</p>

<p>At this time he had already begun to plan his chief work, <i>The
Principles of Geology</i>. The subsidiary title, &ldquo;An Attempt to
Explain the Former Changes of the Earth&rsquo;s Surface by Reference
to Causes now in Operation,&rdquo; gives the keynote of the task to
which Lyell devoted his life. A journey with Murchison in 1828
gave rise to joint papers on the volcanic district of Auvergne and
the Tertiary formations of Aix-en-Provence. After parting
with Murchison he studied the marine remains of the Italian
Tertiary Strata and then conceived the idea of dividing this
geological system into three or four groups, characterized by the
proportion of recent to extinct species of shells. To these groups,
after consulting Dr Whewell as to the best nomenclature, he
gave the names now universally adopted&mdash;Eocene (<i>dawn of
recent</i>), Miocene (<i>less of recent</i>), and Pliocene (<i>more of recent</i>);
and with the assistance of G. P. Deshayes he drew up a table of
shells in illustration of this classification. The first volume of
the <i>Principles of Geology</i> appeared in 1830, and the second in
January 1832. Received at first with some opposition, so far as
its leading theory was concerned, the work had ultimately a
great success, and the two volumes had already reached a second
edition in 1833 when the third, dealing with the successive formations
of the earth&rsquo;s crust, was added. Between 1830 and 1872
eleven editions of this work were published, each so much
enriched with new material and the results of riper thought as
to form a complete history of the progress of geology during
that interval. Only a few days before his death Sir Charles
finished revising the first volume of the 12th edition; the revision
of the second volume was completed by his nephew Mr (afterwards
Sir) Leonard Lyell; and the work appeared in 1876.</p>

<p>In August 1838 Lyell published the <i>Elements of Geology</i>,
which, from being originally an expansion of one section of the
<i>Principles</i>, became a standard work on stratigraphical and
palaeontological geology. This book went through six editions
in Lyell&rsquo;s lifetime (some intermediate editions being styled
<i>Manual of Elementary Geology</i>), and in 1871 a smaller work, the
<i>Student&rsquo;s Elements of Geology</i>, was based upon it. His third
great work, <i>The Antiquity of Man</i>, appeared in 1863, and ran
through three editions in one year. In this he gave a general
survey of the arguments for man&rsquo;s early appearance on the earth,
derived from the discoveries of flint implements in post-Pliocene
strata in the Somme valley and elsewhere; he discussed also
the deposits of the Glacial epoch, and in the same volume he
first gave in his adhesion to Darwin&rsquo;s theory of the origin of
species. A fourth edition appeared in 1873.</p>

<p>In 1831-1833 Lyell was professor of geology at King&rsquo;s College,
London, and delivered while there a course of lectures, which
became the foundation of the <i>Elements of Geology</i>. In 1832 he
married Mary (1809-1873) eldest daughter of Leonard Horner
(<i>q.v.</i>), and she became thenceforward associated with him in
all his work, and by her social qualities making his home a centre
of attraction. In 1834 he made an excursion to Denmark and
Sweden, the result of which was his Bakerian lecture to the
Royal Society &ldquo;On the Proofs of the gradual Rising of Land
in certain Parts of Sweden.&rdquo; He also brought before the
Geological Society a paper &ldquo;On the Cretaceous and Tertiary
Strata of Seeland and Möen.&rdquo; In 1835 he became president
of the Geological Society. In 1837 he was again in Norway
and Denmark, and in 1841 he spent a year in travelling through
the United States, Canada and Nova Scotia. This last journey,
together with a second one to America in 1845, resulted not only
in papers, but also in two works not exclusively geological,
<i>Travels in North America</i> (1845) and <i>A Second Visit to the United
States</i> (1849). During these journeys he estimated the rate of
recession of the falls of Niagara, the annual average accumulation
of alluvial matter in the delta of the Mississippi, and studied
those vegetable accumulations in the &ldquo;Great Dismal Swamp&rdquo;
of Virginia, which he afterwards used in illustrating the formation
of beds of coal. He also studied the coal-formations in
Nova Scotia, and discovered in company with Dr (afterwards Sir
J. W.) Dawson (<i>q.v.</i>) of Montreal, the earliest known landshell,
<i>Pupa vetusta</i>, in the hollow stem of a Sigillaria. In bringing
a knowledge of European geology to bear upon the extended
formations of North America Lyell rendered immense service.
Having visited Madeira and Teneriffe in company with
G. Hartung, he accumulated much valuable evidence on the age
and deposition of lava-beds and the formation of volcanic cones.
He also revisited Sicily in 1858, when he made such observations
upon the structure of Etna as refuted the theory of &ldquo;craters
of elevation&rdquo; upheld by Von Buch and Élie de Beaumont (see
<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1859).</p>

<p>Lyell was knighted in 1848, and was created a baronet in
1864, in which year he was president of the British Association
at Bath. He was elected corresponding member of the French
Institute and of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and
was created a knight of the Prussian Order of Merit.</p>

<p>During the later years of his life his sight, always weak, failed
him altogether. He died on the 22nd of February 1875, and
was buried in Westminster Abbey. Among his characteristics
were his great thirst for knowledge, his perfect fairness and
sound judgment; while the extreme freshness of his mind
enabled him to accept and appreciate the work of younger
men.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYLY<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Lilly</span>, or <span class="sc">Lylie</span>), <span class="bold">JOHN</span> (1553-1606), English writer,
the famous author of <i>Euphues</i>, was born in Kent in 1553 or 1554.
At the age of sixteen, according to Wood, he became a student
of Magdalen College, Oxford, where in due time he proceeded
to his bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degrees (1573 and 1575), and from
whence we find him in 1574 applying to Lord Burghley &ldquo;for
the queen&rsquo;s letters to Magdalen College to admit him fellow.&rdquo;
The fellowship, however, was not granted, and Lyly shortly
after left the university. He complains of what seems to have
been a sentence of rustication passed upon him at some period
in his academical career, in his address to the gentlemen scholars
of Oxford affixed to the second edition of the first part of <i>Euphues</i>,
but in the absence of any further evidence it is impossible to
fix either its date or its cause. If we are to believe Wood, he
never took kindly to the proper studies of the university. &ldquo;For
so it was that his genius being naturally bent to the pleasant
paths of poetry (as if Apollo had given to him a wreath of his
own bays without snatching or struggling) did in a manner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span>
neglect academical studies, yet not so much but that he took
the degrees in arts, that of master being compleated 1575.&rdquo;
After he left Oxford, where he had already the reputation of &ldquo;a
noted wit,&rdquo; Lyly seems to have attached himself to Lord Burghley.
&ldquo;This noble man,&rdquo; he writes in the &ldquo;Glasse for Europe,&rdquo;
in the second part of <i>Euphues</i> (1580), &ldquo;I found so ready being
but a straunger to do me good, that neyther I ought to forget
him, neyther cease to pray for him, that as he hath the wisdom
of Nestor, so he may have the age, that having the policies of
Ulysses he may have his honor, worthy to lyve long, by whom
so many lyve in quiet, and not unworthy to be advaunced by
whose care so many have been preferred.&rdquo; Two years later
we possess a letter of Lyly to the treasurer, dated July 1582,
in which the writer protests against some accusation of dishonesty
which had brought him into trouble with his patron,
and demands a personal interview for the purpose of clearing
his character. What the further relations <span class="correction" title="amended from beween">between</span> them were
we have no means of knowing, but it is clear that neither from
Burghley nor from the queen did Lyly ever receive any substantial
patronage. In 1578 he began his literary career by the
composition of <i>Euphues, or the Anatomy of Wit</i>, which was
licensed to Gabriel Cawood on the 2nd of December, 1578, and published
in the spring of 1579. In the same year the author was incorporated
M.A. at Cambridge, and possibly saw his hopes of court
advancement dashed by the appointment in July of Edmund
Tylney to the office of master of the revels, a post at which, as
he reminds the queen some years later, he had all along been
encouraged to &ldquo;aim his courses.&rdquo; <i>Euphues and his England</i>
appeared in 1580, and, like the first part of the book, won immediate
popularity. For a time Lyly was the most successful
and fashionable of English writers. He was hailed as the author
of &ldquo;a new English,&rdquo; as a &ldquo;raffineur de l&rsquo;Anglois&rdquo;; and, as
Edmund Blount, the editor of his plays, tells us in 1632, &ldquo;that
beautie in court which could not parley Euphuism was as little
regarded as she which nowe there speakes not French.&rdquo; After
the publication of <i>Euphues</i>, however, Lyly seems to have entirely
deserted the novel form himself, which passed into the hands
of his imitators, and to have thrown himself almost exclusively
into play-writing, probably with a view to the mastership of
revels whenever a vacancy should occur. Eight plays by him
were probably acted before the queen by the children of the
Chapel Royal and the children of St Paul&rsquo;s between the years
1584 and 1589, one or two of them being repeated before a
popular audience at the Blackfriars Theatre. Their brisk
lively dialogue, classical colour and frequent allusions to persons
and events of the day maintained that popularity with the
court which <i>Euphues</i> had won. Lyly sat in parliament as
member for Hindon in 1589, for Aylesbury in 1593, for Appleby
in 1597 and for Aylesbury a second time in 1601. In 1589 Lyly
published a tract in the Martin Marprelate controversy, called
<i>Pappe with an hatchet, alias a figge for my Godsonne; Or Crack
me this nut; Or a Countrie Cuffe, &amp;c.</i><a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> About the same time
we may probably date his first petition to Queen Elizabeth.
The two petitions, transcripts of which are extant among the
Harleian MSS., are undated, but in the first of them he speaks
of having been ten years hanging about the court in hope of
preferment, and in the second he extends the period to thirteen
years. It may be conjectured with great probability that the
ten years date from 1579, when Edmund Tylney was appointed
master of the revels with a tacit understanding that Lyly was
to have the next reversion of the post. &ldquo;I was entertained your
Majestie&rsquo;s servaunt by your own gratious favor,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;strengthened with condicions that I should ayme all my
courses at the Revells (I dare not say with a promise, but with
a hopeful Item to the Revercion) for which these ten yeres I
have attended with an unwearyed patience.&rdquo; But in 1589
or 1590 the mastership of the revels was as far off as ever&mdash;Tylney
in fact held the post for thirty-one years&mdash;and that
Lyly&rsquo;s petition brought him no compensation in other directions
may be inferred from the second petition of 1593. &ldquo;Thirteen
yeres your highnes servant but yet nothing. Twenty freinds
that though they saye they will be sure, I finde them sure to be
slowe. A thousand hopes, but all nothing; a hundred promises
but yet nothing. Thus casting up the inventory of my friends,
hopes, promises and tymes, the <i>summa totalis</i> amounteth to just
nothing.&rdquo; What may have been Lyly&rsquo;s subsequent fortunes
at court we do not know. Edmund Blount says vaguely that
Elizabeth &ldquo;graced and rewarded&rdquo; him, but of this there is no
other evidence. After 1590 his works steadily declined in
influence and reputation; other stars were in possession of the
horizon; and so far as we know he died poor and neglected
in the early part of James I.&rsquo;s reign. He was buried in London
at St Bartholomew the Less on the 20th of November, 1606. He was
married, and we hear of two sons and a daughter.</p>

<p><i>Comedies.</i>&mdash;In 1632 Edmund Blount published &ldquo;Six Court
Comedies,&rdquo; including <i>Endymion</i> (1591), <i>Sappho and Phao</i> (1584),
<i>Alexander and Campaspe</i> (1584), <i>Midas</i> (1592), <i>Mother Bombie</i>
(1594) and <i>Gallathea</i> (1592). To these should be added the
<i>Woman in the Moone</i> (Lyly&rsquo;s earliest play, to judge from a
passage in the prologue and therefore earlier than 1584, the date
of <i>Alexander and Campaspe</i>), and <i>Love&rsquo;s Metamorphosis</i>, first
printed in 1601. Of these, all but the last are in prose. A
<i>Warning for Faire Women</i> (1599) and <i>The Maid&rsquo;s Metamorphosis</i>
(1600) have been attributed to Lyly, but on altogether insufficient
grounds. The first editions of all these plays were issued between
1584 and 1601, and the majority of them between 1584 and
1592, in what were Lyly&rsquo;s most successful and popular years.
His importance as a dramatist has been very differently estimated.
Lyly&rsquo;s dialogue is still a long way removed from the
dialogue of Shakespeare. But at the same time it is a great
advance in rapidity and resource upon anything which had gone
before it; it represents an important step in English dramatic
art. His nimbleness, and the wit which struggles with his
pedantry, found their full development in the dialogue of
<i>Twelfth Night</i> and <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>, just as &ldquo;Marlowe&rsquo;s
mighty line&rdquo; led up to and was eclipsed by the majesty and
music of Shakespearian passion. One or two of the songs
introduced into his plays are justly famous and show a real
lyrical gift. Nor in estimating his dramatic position and his
effect upon his time must it be forgotten that his classical and
mythological plots, flavourless and dull as they would be to a
modern audience, were charged with interest to those courtly
hearers who saw in Midas Philip II., Elizabeth in Cynthia and
perhaps Leicester&rsquo;s unwelcome marriage with Lady Sheffield
in the love affair between Endymion and Tellus which brings
the former under Cynthia&rsquo;s displeasure. As a matter of fact
his reputation and popularity as a play-writer were considerable.
Gabriel Harvey dreaded lest Lyly should make a play upon their
quarrel; Meres, as is well known, places him among &ldquo;the best
for comedy&rdquo;; and Ben Jonson names him among those foremost
rivals who were &ldquo;outshone&rdquo; and outsung by Shakespeare.</p>

<p><i>Euphues.</i>&mdash;It was not, however, as a dramatist, but as the
author of <i>Euphues</i>, that Lyly made most mark upon the Elizabethan
world. His plays amused the court circle, but the
&ldquo;new English&rdquo; of his novel threatened to permanently change
the course of English style. The plot of <i>Euphues</i> is extremely
simple. The hero, whose name may very possibly have been
suggested by a passage in Ascham&rsquo;s <i>Schoolmaster</i>, is introduced
to us as still in bondage to the follies of youth, &ldquo;preferring fancy
before friends, and this present humour before honour to come.&rdquo;
His travels bring him to Naples, where he falls in love with
Lucilla, the governor&rsquo;s light-minded daughter. Lucilla is
already pledged to Euphues&rsquo;s friend Philautus, but Euphues&rsquo;s
passion betrays his friendship, and the old lover finds himself
thrown over by both friend and mistress. Euphues himself,
however, is very soon forsaken for a more attractive suitor.
He and Philautus make up their quarrel, and Euphues writes
his friend &ldquo;a cooling card,&rdquo; to be &ldquo;applied to all lovers,&rdquo; which
is so severe upon the fair sex that Lyly feels it necessary to
balance it by a sort of apology addressed &ldquo;to the grave matrons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>161</span>
and honest maidens of Italy.&rdquo; Euphues then leaves Naples
for his native Athens, where he gives himself up to study, of
which the first fruits are two long treatises&mdash;the first, &ldquo;Euphues
and his Ephoebus,&rdquo; a disquisition on the art of education
addressed to parents, and the second, &ldquo;Euphues and Atheos,&rdquo;
a discussion of the first principles of religion. The remainder
of the book is filled up with correspondence between Euphues
and his friends. We have letters from Euphues to Philautus
on the death of Lucilla, to another friend on the death of his
daughter, to one Botonio &ldquo;to take his exile patiently,&rdquo; and to the
youth Alcius, remonstrating with him on his bad behaviour at
the university. Finally a pair of letters, the first from Livia
&ldquo;at the emperour&rsquo;s court to Euphues at Athens,&rdquo; answered by
&ldquo;Euphues to Livia,&rdquo; wind up the first part, and announce to us
Euphues&rsquo;s intention of visiting England. An address from
Lyly to Lord Delawarr is affixed, to which was added in the
second edition &ldquo;An Address to the Gentlemen Scholars of
England.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Euphues and his England</i> is rather longer than the first part.
Euphues and Philautus travel from Naples to England. They
arrive at Dover, halt for the night at Fidus&rsquo;s house at Canterbury,
and then proceed to London, where they make acquaintance
with Surius, a young English gentleman of great birth and
noble blood; Psellus, an Italian nobleman reputed &ldquo;great in
magick&rdquo;; Martius, an elderly Englishman; Camilla, a beautiful
English girl of insignificant family; Lady Flavia and her niece
Fraunces. After endless correspondence and conversation on
all kinds of topics, Euphues is recalled to Athens, and from there
corresponds with his friends. &ldquo;Euphues&rsquo; Glasse for Europe&rdquo;
is a flattering description of England sent to Livia at Naples.
It is the most interesting portion of the book, and throws light
upon one or two points of Lyly&rsquo;s own biography. The author
naturally seized the opportunity for paying his inevitable
tribute to the queen, and pays it in his most exalted style.
&ldquo;O fortunate England that hath such a queene, ungratefull
if thou praye not for hir, wicked if thou do not love hir, miserable
if thou lose hir!&rdquo;&mdash;and so on. The book ends with Philautus&rsquo;s
announcement of his marriage to Fraunces, upon which Euphues
sends characteristic congratulations and retires, &ldquo;tormented
in body and grieved in mind,&rdquo; to the Mount of Silexedra, &ldquo;where
I leave him to his musing or Muses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such is a brief outline of the book which for a time set the
fashion for English prose. Two editions of each part appeared
within the first year after publication, and thirteen editions
of both are enumerated up to 1636, after which, with the exception
of a modernized version in 1718, <i>Euphues</i> was never reprinted
until 1868, when Dr Arber took it in hand. The reasons for its
popularity are not far to seek. As far as matter was concerned
it fell in with all the prevailing literary fashions. Its long
disquisitions on love, religion, exile, women or education, on
court life and country pleasures, handled all the most favourite
topics in the secularized speculation of the time; its foreign
background and travel talk pleased a society of which Lyly
himself said &ldquo;trafic and travel hath woven the nature of all
nations into ours and made this land like arras full of device
which was broadcloth full of workmanship&rdquo;; and, although
Lyly steered clear in it of the worst classical pedantries of the
day, the book was more than sufficiently steeped in classical
learning, and based upon classical material, to attract a literary
circle which was nothing if not humanist. A large proportion
of its matter indeed was drawn from classical sources. The
general tone of sententious moralizing may be traced to Plutarch,
from whom the treatise on education, &ldquo;Euphues and his
Ephoebus,&rdquo; and that on exile, &ldquo;Letter to Botonio to take his
exile patiently,&rdquo; are literally translated, as well as a number of
other shorter passages either taken direct from the Latin versions
or from some of the numerous English translations of Plutarch
then current. The innumerable illustrations based upon a kind
of pseudo natural history are largely taken from Pliny, while
the mythology is that of Virgil and Ovid.</p>

<p>It was not the matter of <i>Euphues</i>, however, so much as the style
which made it famous (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Euphuism</a></span>). The source of Lyly&rsquo;s
peculiar style has been traced by Dr Landmann (<i>Der Euphuismus</i>,
<i>sein Wesen</i>, <i>seine Quelle</i>, <i>seine Geschichte</i>, &amp;c. Giessen, 1881) to
the influence of Don Antonio de Guevara, whose <i>Libro Aureo de
Marco Aurelio</i> (1529)&mdash;a sort of historical romance based upon
Plutarch and upon Marcus Aurelius&rsquo;s <i>Meditations</i>, the object of
which was to produce a &ldquo;mirror for princes,&rdquo; of the kind so
popular throughout the Renaissance&mdash;became almost immediately
popular in England. The first edition, or rather a French
version of it, was translated into English by Lord Berners in
1531, and published in 1534. Before 1560 twelve editions of
Lord Berners&rsquo;s translation had been printed, and before 1578
six different translators of this and later works of Guevara had
appeared. The translation, however, which had most influence
upon English literature was that by North, the well-known
translator of Plutarch, in 1557, called <i>The Dial for Princes,
Compiled by the Reverend Father in God Don Antony of Guevara,
Byshop of Guadix, &amp;c., Englished out of the Frenche by Th. North</i>.
The sententious and antithetical style of the <i>Dial for Princes</i>
is substantially that of <i>Euphues</i>, though Guevara on the whole
handles it better than his imitator, and has many passages of
real force and dignity. The general plan of the two books is also
much the same. In both the biography is merely a peg on
which to hang moral disquisitions and treatises. The use made
of letters is the same in both. Even the names of some of the
characters are similar. Thus Guevara&rsquo;s Lucilla is the flighty
daughter of Marcus Aurelius. Lyly&rsquo;s Lucilla is the flighty
daughter of Ferardo, governor of Naples; Guevara&rsquo;s Livia is
a lady at the court of Marcus Aurelius, Lyly&rsquo;s Livia is a lady at
the court &ldquo;of the emperor,&rdquo; of whom no further description is
given. The 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th chapters of the <i>Dial for
Princes</i> suggested the discussion between Euphues and Atheos.
The letter from Euphues to Alcius is substantially the same
in subject and treatment as that from Marcus Aurelius to his
nephew Epesipo. Both Guevara and Lyly translated Plutarch&rsquo;s
work <i>De educatione liberorum</i>, Lyly, however, keeping closer
than the Spanish author to the original. The use made by Lyly
of the university of Athens was an anachronism in a novel intended
to describe his own time. He borrowed it, however, from
Guevara, in whose book a university of Athens was of course
entirely in place. The &ldquo;cooling card for all fond lovers&rdquo; and
the address to the ladies and gentlemen of Italy have their
counterparts among the miscellaneous letters by Guevara affixed
by North to the <i>Dial for Princes</i>; and other instances of Lyly&rsquo;s
use of these letters, and of two other treatises by Guevara on
court and country life, could be pointed out.</p>

<p>Lyly was not the first to appropriate and develop the Guevaristic
style. The earliest book in which it was fully adopted was
<i>A petite Pallace of Pettie his Pleasure</i>, by George Pettie, which
appeared in 1576, a production so closely akin to <i>Euphues</i> in tone
and style that it is difficult to believe it was not by Lyly. Lyly,
however, carried the style to its highest point, and made it the
dominant literary fashion. His principal followers in it were
Greene, Lodge and Nash, his principal opponent Sir Philip
Sidney; the <i>Arcadia</i> in fact supplanted <i>Euphues</i>, and the
Euphuistic taste proper may be said to have died out about
1590 after a reign of some twelve years. According to Landmann,
Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour Lost</i> is a caricature of the Italianate
and pedantic fashions of the day, not of the peculiar style of
<i>Euphues</i>. The only certain allusion in Shakespeare to the
characteristics of Lyly&rsquo;s famous book is to be found in <i>Henry IV.</i>,
where Falstaff, playing the part of the king, says to Prince Hal,
&ldquo;Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but
also how thou art accompanied; for, though the camomile the
more it is trodden on the faster it grows, yet youth the more it is
wasted the sooner it wears.&rdquo; Here the pompous antithesis is
evidently meant to caricature the peculiar Euphuistic sentence of
court parlance.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYME REGIS,<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> a market town and municipal borough and
watering-place in the western parliamentary division of Dorsetshire,
England, 151 m. W.S.W. of London by the London &amp; South
Western railway, the terminus of a light railway from Axminster.
Pop. (1901) 2095. It is situated at the mouth of a narrow combe
or valley opening upon a fine precipitous coast-line; there is a
sandy shore affording excellent bathing, and the country inland is
beautiful. The church of St Michael and All Angels is mainly
Perpendicular, but the tower (formerly central) and the portion
west of it are Norman. A guildhall and assembly rooms are the
chief public buildings. The principal industries are stone-quarrying
and the manufacture of cement. There is a curved
pier of ancient foundation known as the Cobb. The harbour,
with a small coasting trade, is under the authority of the corporation.
The borough is under a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12
councillors. Area, 1237 acres.</p>

<p>No evidence of settlement on the site of Lyme Regis exists
before that afforded by a grant, dated 774, purporting to be by
Cynewulf, king of the West-Saxons, of land here to the church of
Sherborne, and a similar grant by King Æthelstan to the church
of Glastonbury. In 1086 three manors of Lyme are mentioned:
that belonging to Sherborne abbey, which was granted at the
dissolution to Thomas Goodwin, who alienated it in the following
year; that belonging to Glastonbury, which seems to have
passed into lay lands during the middle ages, and that belonging
to William Belet. The last was acquired by the family of Bayeux,
from whom it passed by marriage to Elias de Rabayne, whose
nephew, Peter Baudrat, surrendered it to the crown in 1315-1316
when the king became lord of one moiety of the borough, henceforth
known as Lyme Regis. Lyme ranked as a port in 1234, and
Edward I. in 1284 granted to the town a charter making it a free
borough, with a merchant gild, and in the same year the mayor
and bailiffs are mentioned. In the following January the bailiffs
were given freedom from pleading without the borough, freedom
from toll and privileges implying considerable foreign trade;
the importance of the port is also evident from the demand of
two ships for the king&rsquo;s service in 1311. In 1332-1333 Edward
III. granted Lyme to the burgesses at a fee-farm of 32 marks;
on the petition of the inhabitants, who were impoverished by
tempests and high tides, this was reduced to 100 shillings in
1410 and to 5 marks in 1481. In 1591 Elizabeth incorporated
Lyme, and further charters were obtained from James I.,
Charles II. and William III. Lyme returned two members to
parliament from 1295 to 1832 when the representation was
reduced to one. The borough was disfranchised in 1867. The
fairs granted in 1553 for the 1st of February and the 20th of
September are now held on altered dates. Trade with France in
wine and cloth was carried on as early as 1284, but was probably
much increased on the erection of the Cobb, first mentioned
in 1328 as built of timber and rock. Its medieval importance as
the only shelter between Portland Roads and the river Exe
caused the burgesses to receive grants of quayage for its maintenance
in 1335 and many subsequent years, while its convenience
probably did much to bring upon Lyme the unsuccessful siege
by Prince Maurice in 1644. In 1685 Lyme was the scene of the
landing of James, duke of Monmouth, in his attempt upon the
throne.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYMINGTON,<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> a municipal borough and seaport in the New
Forest parliamentary division of Hampshire, England, 98 m.
S.W. from London by the London &amp; South Western railway.
Pop. (1901) 4165. It lies on the estuary of the Lymington,
which opens into the Solent. The church of St Thomas à Becket
is an irregular structure, dating from the reign of Henry VI.,
but frequently restored. There is some coasting trade, and
yacht-building is carried on. Regular passenger steamers serve
Yarmouth in the Isle of Wight. In summer the town is frequented
for sea-bathing. It is governed by a mayor, 4 aldermen
and 12 councillors. Area, 1515 acres.</p>

<p>There was a Roman camp near Lymington (<i>Lentune</i>, <i>Lementon</i>),
and Roman relics have been found, but there is no evidence that a
town existed here until after the Conquest. Lymington dates its
importance from the grant of the town to Richard de Redvers,
earl of Devon, in the reign of Henry I. No charter has been
found, but a judgment given under a writ of <i>quo warranto</i> in
1578 confirms to the burgesses freedom from toll, passage and
pontage, the tolls and stallage of the quay and the right to hold
two fairs&mdash;privileges which they claimed under charters of
Baldwin de Redvers and Isabel de Fortibus, countess of Albemarle,
in the 13th century, and Edward Courtenay, earl of
Devon, in 1405. The town was governed by the mayor and
burgesses until the corporation was reformed in 1835. A writ
for the election of a member to parliament was issued in the
reign of Edward III., but no return was made. From 1585 two
members were regularly returned; the number was reduced
to one in 1867, and in 1885 the representation was merged in
that of the county. Fairs on the 13th and 14th of May and the
2nd and 3rd of October, dating from the 13th century, are
still held. The Saturday market probably dates from the same
century. Lymington was made a port in the reign of Henry I.,
and its large shipping trade led to frequent disputes with Southampton
as to the levying of duties. The case was tried in 1329
and decided against Lymington, but in 1750 the judgment was
reversed, and since then the petty customs have been regularly
paid. From an early date and for many centuries salt was the
staple manufacture of Lymington. The rise of the mineral saltworks
of Cheshire led to its decline in the 18th century, and later
the renewed importance of Southampton completed its decay.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYMPH<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> and <span class="bold">LYMPH FORMATION.</span> Lying close to the
blood-vessels of a limb or organ a further set of vessels may be
observed. They are very pale in colour, often almost transparent
and very thin-walled. Hence they are frequently difficult
to find and dissect. These are the lymphatic vessels, and they
are found to be returning a fluid from the tissues to the bloodstream.
When traced back to the tissues they are seen to divide
and ultimately to form minute anastomosing tubules, the <i>lymph
capillaries</i>. The capillaries finally terminate in the spaces
between the structures of the tissue, but whether their free ends
are closed or are in open communication with the tissue spaces
is still undecided. The study of their development shows that
they grow into the tissue as a closed system of minute tubes,
which indicates that in all probability they remain permanently
closed. If we trace the lymphatic vessels towards the thorax we find
that in some part of their course they terminate in structures
known as lymphatic glands. From these again fresh lymphatic
vessels arise which carry the fluid towards the main lymph-vessel,
the <i>thoracic duct</i>. This runs up the posterior wall of the
thorax close to the aorta, and finally opens into the junction of
the internal jugular and left subclavian veins. The lymph-vessels
from the right side of the head and neck and from the
right arm open, however, into the right subclavian vein (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lymphatic System</a></span> below).</p>

<p><i>Chemical Constitution of Lymph.</i>&mdash;The lymph collected
from the thoracic duct during hunger is almost water clear and
yellowish in colour. Its specific gravity varies from 1015 to
1025. It tastes salt and has a faint odour. It is alkaline in
reaction, but is much less alkaline than blood-serum. Like blood
it clots, but clots badly, only forming a soft clot which quickly
contracts. The lymph collected from a lymphatic before it has
passed through a lymph gland contains a few leucocytes, and
though the number of lymphocytes is greater in the lymph after
it has flowed through a gland it is never very great. In normal
states there are no red blood corpuscles.</p>

<p>The total solids amount to 3.6 to 5.7%, the variations
depending upon the amount of protein present. The lymph
during hunger contains only a minute quantity of fat. Sugar
(dextrose) is present in the same concentration as in the blood.
The inorganic constituents are the same as in blood, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>163</span>
apparently the amounts of Ca, Mg and P<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">5</span> are rather less than
in serum. Urea is present to the same amount as in blood.
If the lymph be collected after a meal, one important
alteration is to be found. It now contains an abundance of
fat in a very fine state of subdivision, if fat be present in the
food. The concentrations of protein and dextrose are not
altered during the absorption of these substances.</p>

<p><i>The Significance of Lymph.</i>&mdash;In considering the significance
and use of lymph we must note in the first place that it
forms an alternative medium for the removal of water, dissolved
materials, formed elements or particles away from the tissues.
All materials supplied to a tissue are brought to it by the blood,
and are discharged from the blood through the capillary wall.
They thus come to lie in the tissue spaces between the cells, and
from this supply of material in a dissolved state the cells take up
the food they require. In the opposite direction the cell discharges
its waste products into this same tissue fluid. The
removal of material from the tissue fluid may be effected either
by its being absorbed through the capillary wall into the bloodstream,
or by sending it into the lymphatic vessels and thus
away from the tissue. From this point of view the lymphatics
may be looked upon in a sense as a drainage system of the
tissues. Again, besides discharging fluid and dissolved material
into the tissue spaces, the blood may also discharge leucocytes,
and under many conditions this emigration of leucocytes may be
very extensive. These also may leave the tissue space by the
path of the lymph channels. Moreover, the tissues are at any
time liable to be injured, and the injury as well as damaging many
cells may cause rupture of capillaries (as in bruising) with escape
of red blood-cells into the tissue spaces. If this occurs we know
that the damaged cells are destroyed and their débris removed
either by digestion by leucocytes or by disintegration and
solution. The damage of a tissue also commonly involves an
infection of the damaged area with living micro-organisms, and
these are at once admitted to the tissue spaces. Hence we see
that the lymphatics may be provided as channels by which a
variety of substances can be removed from the tissue spaces.
The question at once arises, is the lymph channel at all times
open to receive the materials present in the tissue space? If
such be the case, lymph is simply tissue fluid, and anything
that modifies the constitution or amount of the tissue fluid
should in like proportion lead to a variation in the amount
and constitution of the lymph. But if the lymph capillary is
a closed tubule at its commencement this does not follow.</p>

<p>From these considerations we see that in the first instance
the whole problem of lymph formation is intimately bound up
with the study of the interchanges of material between the blood
and the various tissue cells. The exchange of material between
blood and tissue cell may possibly be determined in one or both
of two ways. Either it may result from changes taking place
within the tissue cell, or the tissue cell remaining passive material
may be sent to or withdrawn from it owing to a change occurring
either in the composition of the blood or to a change in the
circulation through the tissue. Let us take first the results
following increased activity of a tissue. We know that increased
activity of a tissue means increased chemical change within the
tissue and the production of new chemical bodies of small
molecular size (<i>e.g.</i> water, carbonic acid, &amp;c.). The production of
these metabolites means the destruction of some of the tissue
substance, and to make good this loss the tissue must take a
further amount of material from the blood. We know that this
takes place, and moreover that the waste products resulting
from activity are ultimately removed. The question then
becomes: When does this restoration take place, and what is
the intermediate state of the tissue? We know that increased
activity is always accompanied by an increase in the blood-supply,
indicating a greater supply of nutritive material, though
it may be that, the increased supply required at the actual time
of activity is oxygen only. Simultaneously the opportunity for
a more rapid removal of the waste products is provided. We
have to inquire then: Does this increased vascularity necessarily
mean an increased outpouring of water and dissolved
material into the tissues, for this might follow directly from the
greater filling of the capillaries, or from the increased attracting
power of the tissues to water (osmotic effect) due to the sudden
production of substances of small molecular size within the
tissue? The other possibility is that the increased volume of
blood sent to the tissue is for the sole purpose of giving it a more
rapid supply of oxygen, and that the ordinary normal blood-supply
would amply suffice for renewing the chemical material used up
during activity. Tissues undoubtedly vary among themselves
in the amount of water and other materials they take from the
blood when thrown into activity, and their behaviour in this
respect depends upon the work they are called upon to perform.
We must discriminate between the substance required by and
consumed by the tissue, the chemical food which on combustion
yields the energy by which the tissue performs work, and, on the
other hand, the substance taken from the blood and either with
or without further elaboration discharged from the tissue (as,
for instance, in the process of secretion). The tissue contains in
itself a store of food amply sufficient to enable it to continue
working for a long time after its blood-supply has been stopped,
and everything indicates that the supply of chemical energy to
the tissue may be slow or even withheld for a considerable time.
Hence we are led to conclude that the increased flow of blood
sent to a tissue when it is thrown into activity is first and foremost
to give that tissue an increased oxygen supply; secondly,
to remove waste carbonic acid; thirdly, and only in the case of
some tissues, to provide water salts and other materials for the
outpouring of a secretion, as an instance of which we may take
the kidney as a type. Hence there is no need to suppose that an
extensive accumulation of fluid and dissolved substances takes
place within a tissue when it becomes active. This must be an
accumulation which would lead to an engorgement of the tissue
spaces and then to a discharge of fluid along the lymph channels.
To enable us to determine the various points just raised we must
know whether an increased blood-supply to a tissue necessarily
means an increased exudation of fluid into the tissue spaces,
and moreover we must study the exchange of fluid between a
tissue and the blood under as varied a series of conditions as
possible, subsequently examining whether exchange of fluid and
other substances between the tissue and the blood necessarily
determines quantitatively the amount of lymph flowing from
the tissue. Hence we will first study the exchanges between
the blood and a tissue, and then turn our attention to the
lymph-flow from the tissues.</p>

<p><i>The Exchanges of Fluids and dissolved Substances between
the Blood and the Tissues.</i>&mdash;Numerous experiments have
been performed in studying the conditions under which fluid
passes into the tissues and tissue spaces&mdash;or in the reverse
direction into the blood. We may group them into (1)
conditions during which the total volume of circulating
fluid is increased or decreased; (2) conditions in which the
character of the blood is altered, <i>e.g.</i> it is made more watery
or its saline concentration is altered; (3) conditions in which
the blood-supply to the part is altered; (4) conditions in which
the physical character of the capillary wall is altered.</p>

<p>1. The total volume of blood in an animal has been increased
among other ways by the transfusion of the blood of one animal
directly into the veins of a second of the same species. It is
found that within a very short time a large percentage of the
plasma has been discharged from the blood-vessels. It has been
sent into the tissues, notably the muscles, and it may be noted
in passing without producing any increase in the lymph-flow
from these vessels. An analogous experiment, but one which
avoids the fallacy introduced by injecting a second animal&rsquo;s
blood, has been performed by driving all the blood out of one
hind limb by applying a rubber bandage tightly round it from
the foot upwards. This increases the volume of blood circulating
in the rest of the body, and again a rapid disappearance of the
fluid part of the blood from the vessels was observed&mdash;the fluid
being mainly sent into the muscles, as was indicated by showing
that the specific gravity of the muscles fell during the experiment.
The experiments converse to these have also been studied.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>164</span>
Bleeding is very rapidly followed by a large inflow of fluid into
the circulating blood&mdash;this fluid being derived from all the tissues,
and especially again from the muscles. Or again, when the
bandage from the limb in the above-cited experiment was
removed, the total capacity of the circulatory system was
thereby suddenly increased, and it was found that the total
volume of blood increased correspondingly, the increased volume
of fluid being drawn from the tissues and especially again from
the muscles. The rapidity with which this movement of fluid
into or out of the blood takes place is very striking. The explanation
usually offered is that the movement is effected by
changes in the capillary pressure due to the alteration in the
volume of blood circulating. While this seems feasible when the
volume of blood is increased, it does not offer a satisfactory
explanation of the rapid movement of fluid from the tissues
when the volume of the blood is decreased. One must therefore
look for yet further factors in this instance.</p>

<p>2. Let us next turn attention to the second of our three main
variations, viz. that in which the composition of the blood is
altered. It has long been known that the injection of water,
or of solutions of soluble bodies such as salts, urea, sugar, &amp;c.,
leads to a very rapid exchange of water and salts between the
blood and the tissues. Thus if a solution less concentrated
than the blood be injected, the blood is thereby diluted, but
with very great rapidity water leaves the blood and is taken up
by the tissues. Again, if a strong sugar or salt solution be
injected, the first effect is a big discharge of water from the tissues
into the blood and the movement of fluid is effected with great
rapidity. In these instances a new physical factor is brought
into play, viz. that of osmosis. When a solution of lower osmotic
pressure than the blood is injected the osmotic pressure of the
blood falls temporarily below that of the tissues, and water is
therefore attracted to the tissues. The converse is the case
when a solution of osmotic pressure higher than the blood is
injected. This at first sight seems to be an all-sufficient explanation
of the results recorded, but difficulties arise when we
find that the tissues are not equally active in producing the
effects. Thus it is found that the muscles and skin act as the
chief water depot, while such tissues as the liver, intestines or
pancreas take a relatively small share in the exchange. Again,
when a strong sodium chloride solution is injected a considerable
part of the sodium chloride is soon found to have left the blood,
and it has been shown that the chloride depot is not identical
with the water depot. The lung, for instance, is found to take
up relatively far more of the salt than other tissues. Simultaneously
with the passage of the salt into the tissue an exchange of
water from the tissue into the blood can be observed, both
processes being carried out very rapidly. The result is that the
blood very quickly returns to a state in which its osmotic pressure
is only slightly raised; the tissue, on the other hand, loses water
and gains salt, and its osmotic pressure and specific gravity
therefore rises. Again, the tissues do not participate equally in
producing the final result, nor is the tissue which gives up the
largest amount of water necessarily that which gains the largest
amount of salt. The results following the injection of solutions
of other bodies of small molecular size, <i>e.g.</i> urea or sugar, are
quite analogous to those above described in the case of the non-toxic
salt solutions. Hence we see that the rate of exchange of
fluid and dissolved substance between a tissue and the blood can
be extremely rapid and that the exchange can take place in
either direction. We may also conclude that the main cause
of the exchange, and possibly the only one, is the osmotic action
set up by the solution injected, and that muscle tissue is particularly
active in the process.</p>

<p>Seeing that a very considerable amount of water or of dissolved
substance can be taken up from the blood into a tissue,
the question next arises: Where is this material held, in the
tissue cell or in the tissue space? Immediately the water or
salt leaves the blood it reaches the tissue space, but unless the
process be extreme in amount it probably passes at once into
the tissue cell itself and is stored there. If the process is excessive
oedema is set up and fluid accumulates in the tissue space.</p>

<p>These, taken quite briefly, are some of the more important
conditions under which fluid exchanges, take place. They are
selected here because of the extent and rapidity of the changes
effected.</p>

<p>3. The third factor which may bring about a change in the
amount of fluid sent to a tissue is a variation in the capillary
pressure. A rise in capillary pressure will, if filtration can occur
through the capillary wall, cause an increased exudation of fluid
from the blood. Thus the rise in general blood-pressure following
the injection of a salt solution could cause an increased filtration
into the tissues. Or again, the hydraemia following a salt injection
would favour an increased exudation because the blood
would be more readily filtrable. We, however, know very little
of the effect of changes in capillary pressure upon movement
of fluid into the tissue spaces and tissues, most of such observations
being confined to a study of their effect upon lymph-flow.
We will therefore return to them in this connexion.</p>

<p>4. The remaining factor to be mentioned is a change in the
character of the capillary wall. It is well known that many
poisons can excite an increased exudation from the blood and
the tissue may become oedematous. Of such bodies we may
mention cantharidin and the lymphogogues of Class I (see later).
A like change is also probably the cause of the oedema of nephritis
and of heart disease. It has also been suggested that the capillaries
of different organs show varying degrees of permeability,
a suggestion to which we will return later.</p>

<p><i>Lymph Formation.</i>&mdash;There are two theories current at the
present day offering explanations of the manner in which lymph
is formed. The first, which owes its inception to Ludwig, explains
lymph formation upon physical grounds. Thus according to
this theory the lymphatics are open capillary vessels at their
origin in the tissues along which the tissue fluid is driven. The
tissue fluid is discharged from the blood by filtration, and therefore
its amount varies directly with the capillary pressure. The
amount of fluid movement also is further determined by osmotic
actions and by the permeability of the capillary wall.</p>

<p>The second theory first actively enunciated by Heidenhain
regards lymph formation as a secretory process of the capillary
wall, <i>i.e.</i> one in the discharge of which these cells perform work
and are not merely passive as in the former theory. As we shall
see, it is now probable that neither theory is completely correct.</p>

<p>In considering lymph formation we have to examine both
the total amount of lymph formed in the body and the variations
in amount leaving each separate organ under different conditions.
In most investigations the lymph was collected from the thoracic
duct, <i>i.e.</i> it was the lymph returned from all parts of the body
with the exception of the right arm and right side of the head and
neck. The collection of the lymph from organs is much more
difficult to effect, and hence has not, to the present, been so
extensively studied. We will consider first variations in the
amount of the thoracic duct lymph. Lymph is always flowing
along the thoracic duct, and if the body is at rest, it has been
shown that this lymph is coming practically entirely from the
intestines and liver, chiefly, moreover, from the liver. The
variations in the amount flowing under various conditions has
been extensively studied. We will discuss them under the following
headings: Changes brought about (<i>a</i>) by altered circulatory
conditions, (<i>b</i>) by the injection of various substances, and (<i>c</i>) as
a result of throwing an organ into activity.</p>

<p>Ligature of the portal vein leads to an increased flow of duct
lymph. Ligature of the inferior vena cava above the diaphragm
also leads to a large increase in the flow of duct lymph. Ligature
of the aorta may result in either an increased or decreased
flow of direct lymph. One explanation of these results has been
offered from a study of the changes in capillary pressure set up
in the main organs involved. Thus, after ligature of the portal
vein the capillary pressure in the intestines rises, and it was
proved that the increase in thoracic duct lymph came from the
intestines. Ligaturing the inferior vena cava causes a big rise
in the pressure in the liver capillaries, the intestinal capillary
pressure remaining practically unaltered. Here it was proved
that the increase in lymph-flow came from the liver and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>
more copious in amount than in the former instance. A further
difference is that this lymph is more concentrated, a feature
which always characterizes liver lymph. Ligature of the aorta
may or may not cause a rise in the liver capillary pressure, and
it has been shown that if the pressure rises there is an increased
lymph-flow from the liver and conversely. The increase of
lymph comes entirely in this instance also from the liver. It is
in fact but a special instance of the former experiment. From
these results it has been argued that lymph formation is simply
a filtration fundamentally, and the lymph-flow is determined
mainly by the capillary pressure. Variations in the quantity of
lymph issuing from different organs have been on this theory
ascribed to differences in the permeability of the capillaries of
the organs. Thus as liver lymph is richest in protein content
and is produced in greatest amount, it has been concluded
that the liver capillaries possess the highest permeability. The
intestines stand next in producing a concentrated lymph, and
their capillaries are therefore assumed to stand second as regards
permeability. Lastly, the lymph coming from limbs and other
organs is much poorer in solids and much less copious in amount.
Hence it is argued that their capillaries show the least permeability.
It is, however, very unsafe to compare the liver capillaries
with those of other organs, since they are not in reality
capillaries but rather venous sinuses, and their relation to the
liver cells is characteristically different from that of ordinary
capillaries. If an animal is at rest, no lymph flows from the hind
limbs. To obtain a sample of limb lymph it is necessary to
massage the limb. If, however, the veins to the limb be ligatured,
we obtain a flow of lymph. The ligature of course causes
a rise of the capillary pressure, and it has been argued that
this rise of pressure starts a filtration through the capillary wall
and hence a flow of lymph. But the stoppage of the blood-flow
also damages the capillary wall and tissue cells by asphyxiation,
and the resulting lymph-flow is in all probability the resultant
of many complex processes. This case is analogous to the production
of oedema in cases of heart disease where the circulation
is feeble and the oxygen supply to the parts deficient. The
results of these experiments form the main evidence in support
of the filtration theory of lymph formation. They were first
systematically studied by Heidenhain, to whom we owe so much
of our knowledge of lymph formation. He did not, however,
conclude that they established the filtration theory.</p>

<p>In continuing his observations Heidenhain next studied the
results following the injection of a number of substances into
the blood. He found many which on injection gave rise to an
increased lymph-flow from the thoracic duct, and arranged them
in two classes. As instances of lymphogogues of the first class
we may mention extract of mussels, leech extract, peptone,
extract of crayfish muscle, extract of strawberries, of raspberries
and many other like substances. Lymphogogues of the second
class comprise neutral salt solutions, urea, sugar, &amp;c. Considering
the latter class first we may take as a type a solution of sodium
chloride. Injection of such a solution causes a large increase in
the lymph-flow, and it has been proved that the lymph comes
from the liver and intestines only&mdash;chiefly from the former.
It is especially to be noted that there is no lymph-flow from the
limbs, and the same is true for all lymphogogues of this class.
As indicated above, the injection of a saline solution leads to a
large and rapidly effected transport of fluid from the blood into
muscle tissue, but though there is this large increase in tissue
fluid, no lymph flows from the tissue. This result very powerfully
disfavours the filtration theory of lymph formation. It
practically refutes the idea that lymph formation is solely dependent
upon such processes as filtration, osmosis and capillary
permeability only. It brings out quite clearly that the exchange
of fluid and dissolved salts, &amp;c., between the blood and a tissue,
and the flow of lymph from that tissue, are two separate and
distinct processes, and especially that the first does not determine
the second. Also it is to be noted that the injection of a strong
salt solution also excites a flow of duct lymph, again arising from
the liver and intestines, but none from the limbs. In this instance,
as previously stated, the muscles of the limbs are losing
water, and so presumably are the liver and intestinal cells.
This independence of tissue-blood exchange and lymph-flow
is distinctly in favour of the view, which is rapidly gaining ground
from histological observations, that in all instances the lymphatics
commence in a tissue as closed capillary vessels.</p>

<p>Turning, in the next place, to the lymphogogues of the first
class, it has been proved that the origin of this increase of flow
is again from the liver. Very many of the substances of this
class are bodies which may when taken cause urticarial (nettle-rash)
eruptions, a state which is generally regarded as being due
to an action upon the capillary endothelium. Their action as
lymphogogues is also generally ascribed to an effect upon the
capillary wall rendering it according to some more permeable,
according to others leading to a direct secretory action on the
part of the endothelium. We also know that many of the bodies
of this class act upon the liver in other directions than in exciting
an increased lymph production. Thus they may cause an
increase in bile secretion, or, as in the case of peptone, the liver
cells may be excited to produce a new chemical material, in this
instance an antithrombin.</p>

<p>We have now to consider the effect of throwing an organ into
activity upon the lymph-flow from the organ. In all cases in
which it has been examined it is found that increased activity
is accompanied by increased lymph-flow. Thus, to take the
instance of the submaxillary gland, which at rest does not discharge
any lymph, stimulation of the chorda tympani is followed
by a flow of lymph accompanying the flow of saliva simultaneously
excited. The stimulation of the nerve also produces
dilatation of the blood-vessels and therefore a rise in capillary
pressure. But that this vascular change is not the factor
determining the lymph-flow is proved by the administration of
a small dose of atropine, which arrests the secretion without
influencing the vascular reaction following chorda stimulation.
After the atropine no lymph-flow occurs on stimulating the
nerve. Many other instances of a similar kind might be adduced.
Thus, we have seen that peptone specifically excites
the liver cells and also causes an increased lymph-flow from the
liver; or, as a last instance, the injection of bile salt excites a
flow of bile and also excites a flow of lymph from the liver.
The supporters of the filtration theory have argued that as
activity of a tissue is necessarily accompanied by the discharge
of metabolites from the active tissue cells, and as these are of
small molecular size, they must set up an osmotic effect. Water
is therefore drawn into the tissue spaces, and this rise in fluid
content results mechanically in a flow of lymph from the organ.
The lymph simply drains away along the open lymphatics.
This argument, however, loses all its force when we recall the
fact that we may set up an enormous flow of fluid and salt into
a tissue and its tissue spaces without causing the least flow of
lymph. Further, there is no reason to suppose that the metabolites
discharged from a tissue during activity are produced in
large quantities. The chief metabolite is undoubtedly carbonic
acid, and this diffuses very rapidly and is quickly carried away
by the blood. If, moreover, as is probably the case, the lymphatics
commence as closed capillaries, we have a further difficulty
in explaining how the fluid is driven through the lymphatic wall.
Either we must imagine the wall to be porous or there must be
a greater pressure outside than inside, and it is very difficult
to conceive how this is possible. As a general conclusion, then, it
seems much more probable that we are here dealing with a
secretory process, and that the active tissue produces some
substance or substances&mdash;it may be carbonic acid&mdash;which
throws the lymphatic capillary cells into activity.</p>

<p>To sum up in a few words the present state of our knowledge
as to lymph formation we may say that the exchange of water
and salts between the blood and the tissues is probably entirely
determined by processes of filtration and osmosis. Further, that
the physical condition of the capillary cells is frequently altered
by many chemical substances, and that in consequence it may
permit exudation into the tissue spaces much more freely.
In the next place, the flow of lymph from a tissue is not solely
determined by the amount of the tissue fluids. The lymph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span>
capillaries start as closed tubules, and the endothelial walls of
these tubules play an active part (secretory) in determining
when water and other substances shall be admitted into the
capillary and further determine the quantity of such discharge.
Apparently, too, these cells are specifically excited when the
tissue is thrown into activity, the exciting substance being a
metabolite from the active tissue. Leucocytes also are capable
of passing through or between the endothelial cells of the lymph
capillary.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYMPHATIC SYSTEM.<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> In anatomy, the lymphatic system
(Lat. <i>lympha</i>, clear water) comprises the <i>lymphoid</i> or <i>adenoid</i>
tissue so plentifully distributed about the body, especially in the
course of the alimentary canal (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Connective Tissues</a></span>),
<i>lymph spaces</i>, <i>lymphatic vessels</i> of which the lacteals are modifications,
<i>lymphatic glands</i>, <i>haemolymph glands</i>, and the <i>thoracic</i>
and <i>right lymphatic ducts</i> by which the lymph (<i>q.v.</i>) finally reaches
the veins.</p>

<p><i>Lymph spaces</i> are mere spaces in the connective tissue, which
usually have no special lining, though sometimes there is a layer
of endothelial cells like those of the lymphatic and blood vessels.
Most of these spaces are very small, but sometimes, as in the case
of the <i>sub-epicranial space</i> of the scalp, the <i>capsule of Tenon</i> in
the orbit, and the <i>retropharyngeal space</i> in the neck, they are
large and are adaptations to allow free movement. Opening from
these spaces, and also communicating with the serous membranes
by small openings called stomata,<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> are the <i>lymph capillaries</i> (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vascular System</a></span>), which converge to the <i>lymphatic vessels</i>.
These resemble veins in having an internal layer of endothelium,
a middle unstriped muscular coat, and an external coat of
fibrous tissue, though in the smaller vessels the middle coat is
wanting. They have numerous endothelial valves, formed of
two crescentic segments allowing the lymph to pass toward the
root of the neck. When the vessels are engorged these valves are
marked by a constriction, and so the lymphatics have a beaded
appearance. The vessels divide and anastomose very freely,
and for this reason they do not, like the veins, increase in calibre
as they approach their destination. It is usual to divide the
lymphatic vessels into a superficial and a deep set; speaking
generally, the superficial ones are found near the course of the
superficial veins, while the deeper ones accompany the arteries.
Probably any single drop of lymph passes sooner or later through
one or more lymphatic glands, and so those vessels which are
approaching a gland are called <i>afferent</i>, while those leaving are
spoken of as <i>efferent lymphatics</i>. The <i>lacteals</i> are special
lymphatic vessels which carry the chyle from the intestine;
they begin in lymphatic spaces in the villi and round the
solitary and agminated glands, and pass into the mesentery,
where they come in contact with a large number of <i>mesenteric
glands</i> before reaching the <i>receptaculum chyli</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>lymphatic glands</i> are pink bodies situated in the course
of the lymphatic vessels, to which they act as filters. They
are generally oval in shape and about the size of a bean, but
sometimes, especially in the groin, they form irregular flattened
masses 2 in. long, while, at other times, they are so small as
almost to escape notice. They are usually found in groups.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Each gland has a fibrous capsule from which trabeculae pass
toward the centre, where they break up and interlace, forming a network,
and in this way a cortical and medullary region for each gland
is distinguished; the intervals are nearly filled by lymphoid tissue,
but close to the trabeculae is a lymph path or sinus, which is only
crossed by the reticular stroma of the lymphoid tissue, and this
probably acts as a mechanical sieve, entangling foreign particles;
as an example of this the bronchial glands are black from carbon
strained off in its passage from the lungs, while the axillary glands
in a tattooed arm are blue. The blood-vessels enter at one spot, the
<i>hilum</i>, and are distributed along the trabeculae. In addition to
their function as filters the lymphatic glands are probably one of the
sources from which the leucocytes are derived.</p>

<p>The exact position of the various groups of glands is very important
from a medical point of view, but here it is only possible to
give a brief sketch which will be helped by reference to the accompanying
diagram. In the head are found <i>occipital</i> and <i>mastoid
glands</i> (fig. 1, &beta;), which drain the back of the scalp; <i>internal maxillary
glands</i>, in the zygomatic fossa, draining the orbit, palate, nose and
membranes of the brain; <i>preauricular glands</i> (fig. 1, &alpha;), embedded
in the parotid, draining the side of the scalp, pinna, tympanum and
lower eyelid; and <i>buccal glands</i>, draining the cheek region. In the
neck are the <i>superficial cervical glands</i> (fig. 1, &gamma;), along the course of the
external jugular vein, draining the surface of the neck; the <i>submaxillary
glands</i> (fig. 1, &delta;), lying just above the salivary gland of the
same name and draining the front of the face and scalp; the <i>submental
glands</i> (fig. 1, &epsilon;), beneath the chin, draining the lower lip, as
well as sometimes the upper, and the front of the tongue; the
<i>retropharyngeal glands</i>, draining the naso-pharynx and tympanum;
the <i>pretracheal glands</i>, draining the trachea and lower part of the
thyroid body; and the <i>deep cervical glands</i>, which are by far the
most important and form a great mass close to the internal jugular
vein; they receive afferent vessels from most of the glands already
mentioned and so are liable to be affected in any trouble of the head
or neck, especially of the deeper parts. Into them the lymphatics of
the brain pass directly. The lower part of this mass is sometimes
distinguished as a separate group
called the <i>supra-clavicular glands</i>,
which drain the back of the neck
and receive afferents from the
occipital and axillary glands. The
efferents from the deep cervical
glands join to form a common
vessel known as the <i>jugular lymphatic
trunk</i>, and this usually opens
into the thoracic duct on the left
side and the right lymphatic duct
on the right.</p>

<p>In the thorax are found <i>intercostal
glands</i> (fig. 2, I.), near the vertebral
column draining the back of the
thoracic walls and pleura; <i>internal
mammary glands</i>, draining the front
of the same parts as well as the
inner part of the breast and the
upper part of the abdominal wall;
<i>diaphragmatic glands</i>, draining that
structure and the convex surface
of the liver; <i>anterior, middle, posterior
and superior mediastinal
glands</i>, draining the contents of
those cavities. The <i>bronchial glands</i>,
draining the lungs, have already
been referred to.</p>

<p>In the abdomen and pelvis the
glands are usually grouped round
the large arteries and are divided
into visceral and parietal. Among
the visceral are the <i>gastric glands</i>,
draining the stomach (these are
divided into <i>coronary</i>, <i>subpyloric</i>
and <i>retropyloric</i> groups); the <i>splenic
glands</i> at the hilum of the spleen,
draining that organ, the tail of the
pancreas and the fundus of the
stomach; the <i>hepatic glands</i> in the
small omentum, draining the lower
surface and deep parts of the liver;
the <i>pancreatic glands</i>, behind the
lesser sac of the peritoneum, draining
the head and body of the
pancreas, the <i>superior mesenteric
glands</i>; from one to two hundred
in number, lying in the mesentery
and receiving the lacteals; the <i>ileo-caecal glands</i>, draining the caecum,
one of which is known as the <i>appendicular</i> gland and drains the
vermiform appendix and right ovary; the <i>colic glands</i> along the right
and middle colic arteries, draining the ascending and transverse
colon; the <i>inferior mesenteric glands</i> in the course of that artery, draining
the descending iliac and pelvic colons; the <i>rectal</i> glands, behind
the rectum, draining its upper part.</p>

<p>Among the parietal glands are the <i>external iliac glands</i>, divided into
a lateral and mesial set (see fig. 2, E.I.), and receiving the inguinal
efferent vessels and lymphatics from the bladder, prostate, cervix
uteri, upper part of the vagina, glans penis vel clitoridis and urethra.
The <i>supra</i> and <i>infra-umbilical glands</i> receive the deep lymphatics of
the abdominal wall, the former communicating with the liver, the
latter with the bladder. From the latter, vessels pass to the epigastric
gland lying in front of the termination of the external iliac
artery. The <i>internal iliac glands</i> (fig. 2, I. I.) are situated close to the
branches of this artery and drain the rectum, vagina, prostate,
urethra, buttock and perinaeum. <i>Common iliac glands</i> (fig. 2, C.I.)
lie around that artery and receive afferents from the external and
internal iliac glands as well as a few from the pelvic viscera.<a name="fa2j" id="fa2j" href="#ft2j"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>167</span>
<i>aortic glands</i> are grouped all round the length of the aorta, and are
divided into <i>pre</i>-, <i>retro</i>- and <i>lateral aortic</i> groups (fig. 2 P.A. and L),
all of which communicate freely. The upper preaortic glands are
massed round the coeliac axis, and receive afferents from the gastric,
hepatic, splenic and pancreatic glands; they are known as <i>coeliac
glands</i>. The <i>lateral aortic glands</i> drain the kidney, adrenal, testis,
ovary, fundus of uterus and lateral abdominal walls. In the upper
extremity a few small glands are sometimes found near the deep
arteries of the forearm. At the bend of the elbow are the <i>ante-cubital</i>
glands (fig. 1 &lambda;) and just above the internal condyle, one or
two <i>supra-trochlear glands</i> (fig. 1, &theta;). The <i>axillary glands</i> (fig. 1, &eta;)
are perhaps the most practically important in the body. They are
divided into four sets: (1) <i>external</i>, along the axillary vessels,
draining the greater part of the arm; (2) <i>anterior</i>, behind the lower
border of the pectoralis major muscle, draining the surface of the
thorax including the breast and upper part of the abdomen; (3)
<i>posterior</i> along the subscapular artery, draining the back and side of
the trunk as low as the umbilical zone; (4) superior or <i>infra-clavicular
glands</i> (fig. 1, &zeta;), receiving the efferents of the former groups as well
as lymphatics accompanying the cephalic vein. In the lower limb
all the superficial lymphatics pass up to the groin, where there are
two sets of glands arranged like a T. The <i>superficial femoral</i> glands
(fig. 1, &lambda;) are the vertical ones, and are grouped round the internal
saphenous vein; they are very large, drain the surface of the leg,
and are usually in two parallel rows. The <i>inguinal glands</i> form the
cross bar of the T (fig. 1, &kappa;), and drain part of the buttock, the surface
of the abdomen below the umbilicus and the surface of the genital
organs. The deep lymphatics of the leg drain into the <i>anterior tibial
gland</i> on that artery, the <i>popliteal glands</i> in that space, and the <i>deep
femoral glands</i> surrounding the common femoral vein.</p>

<p class="pt2">The <i>thoracic duct</i> begins as an irregular dilatation known as the
<i>receptaculum chyli</i>, opposite the first and second lumbar vertebrae,
which receives all the abdominal lymphatics as well as
those of the lower intercostal spaces. The duct runs up on the
right of the aorta through the posterior mediastinum and
then traverses the superior mediastinum to the left of the
oesophagus. At the root of the neck it receives the
lymphatics of the left arm and left side of the neck and
opens into the beginning of the left innominate vein, usually
by more than one opening.</p>

<p>The <i>right lymphatic duct</i> collects the lymphatics from the
right side of the neck and thorax, the right arm, right
lung, right side of the heart and upper surface of the liver;
it is often represented by several ducts which open separately
into the right innominate vein.</p>

<p><i>Haemolymph glands</i> are structures which have only been
noticed since 1884. They differ from lymphatic glands in
their much greater vascularity. They assist the spleen in
the destruction of red blood corpuscles, and probably
explain or help to explain the fact that the spleen can be
removed without ill effects. In man they extend along
the vertebral column from the coeliac axis to the pelvis,
but are specially numerous close to the renal arteries.</p>

<p><i>Embryology.</i>&mdash;The lymphatic vessels are possibly developed
by the hollowing out of mesenchyme cells in the same way that
the arteries are; these cells subsequently coalesce and form
tubes (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vascular System</a></span>). There is, however, a good
deal of evidence to show that they are originally offshoots of
the venous system, and that their permanent openings into
the veins are either their primary points of communication or
are secondarily acquired. The lymphatic and haemolymph
glands are probably formed by the proliferation of lymphocytes
around networks of lymphatic vessels; the dividing
lymphocytes form the lymphoid tissue, and eventually the
network breaks up to form distinct glands into which blood
vessels penetrate. If the blood vessels enlarge more than the
lymphatic, haemolymph glands result, but if the lymphatic
vessels become predominant  ordinary lymphatic glands are
formed. At an early stage in the embryo pig two thoracic
ducts are formed, one on either side of the aorta, and the
incomplete fusion of these may account for the division often
found in man&rsquo;s duct. In the embryo pig too there have
been found two pairs of lymph hearts for a short period.</p>

<p><i>Comparative Anatomy.</i>&mdash;A lymphatic system is recognized in
all the Craniata, and in the lower forms (fishes and Amphibia) it
consists chiefly of lymph spaces and sinuses in communication with
the coelom. In fishes, for instance, there is a large <i>subvertebral
lymph sinus</i> surrounding the aorta and another within the spinal
canal. In Amphibia the subvertebral sinus is also found, and in the
Anura (frogs and toads) there is a great <i>subcutaneous lymph sinus</i>.
<i>Lymph hearts</i> are muscular dilatations of vessels and are found in
fishes, amphibians, reptiles and bird embryos, and drive the lymph
into the veins; they are not known in adult mammals.</p>

<p>In birds the thoracic duct is first recognized, and opens into both
right and left precaval veins, as it always does in some mammals.
In birds, however, some of the lymphatics open into the sacral
veins, and it is doubtful whether true lymphatic glands ever occur.
In birds and mammals lymphatic vessels become more definite and
numerous and are provided with valves.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Diseases of the Lymphatic System and Ductless Glands.</i></p>

<p><i>Lymphadenitis</i> or inflammatory infection of the lymphatic glands,
is a condition characterized by hyperaemia of and exudation into
the gland, which becomes reader, firmer and larger than usual.
Three varieties may be distinguished: simple, suppurative and
tuberculous. The cause is always the absorption of some toxic or
infective material from the periphery. This may take place in
several of the acute infectious diseases, notably in scarlet fever,
mumps, diphtheria and German measles, or may be the result of
poisoned wounds. The lymphatic glands are also affected in constitutional
diseases such as syphilis. Simple lymphadenitis usually
subsides of its own accord, but if toxins are produced in the inflamed
area the enlargement is obvious and painful, while if pyogenic
organisms are absorbed the inflammation progresses to suppuration.</p>

<p><i>Tuberculous lymphadenitis</i> (scrofula) is due to the infection of the
lymph glands by Koch&rsquo;s tubercle bacillus. This was formerly known
as &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Evil,&rdquo; as it was believed that the touch of the royal hand
had power to cure it. It occurs most commonly in children and
young adults whose surroundings are unhealthy, and who are liable
to develop tuberculous disease from want of sufficient food and fresh
air. Some local focus of irritation is usually present. The ways in
which the tubercle bacillus enters the body are much disputed, but
catarrh of the mucous membranes is regarded as a predisposing
factor, and the tonsils as a probable channel of infection. Any
lymphoid tissue in the body may be the seat of tuberculous disease,
but the glands of the neck are the most commonly involved. The
course of the disease is slow and may extend over a period of years.
The earliest manifestation is an enlargement of the gland. It is
possible in this stage for spontaneous healing to take place, but
usually the disease progresses to caseation, in which tuberculous
nodules are found diffused throughout the gland. Occasionally this
stage may end in calcification of the caseous matter, the gland shrinking
and becoming hard; but frequently suppuration follows from
liquefaction of the caseating material. Foci of pus occur throughout
the gland, causing destruction of the tissue, so that the gland may
become a single abscess cavity. If left to itself the abscess sooner or
later bursts at one or several points, leaving ulcerated openings
through which a variable amount of pus escapes. Temporary healing
may take place, to be again followed by further breaking down of the
gland. This condition, if untreated, may persist for years and may
finally give rise to a general tuberculosis. The treatment consists
mainly in improving the general health with good diet, fresh air
(particularly sea air), cod-liver oil and iron, and the removal of all
sources of local irritation such as enlarged tonsils, adenoids, &amp;c. Vaccination
with tuberculin (TR) may be useful. Suppuration and extension
of the disease require operative measures, and removal of
the glands <i>en masse</i> can now be done through so small an opening as
to leave only a very slight scar.</p>

<p>In <i>Tabes mesenterica</i> (tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands),
usually occurring in children, the glands of the mesentery and retroperitonaeum
become enlarged, and either caseate or occasionally
suppurate. The disease may be primary or may be secondary to
tuberculous disease of the intestines or to pulmonary phthisis.
The patients are pale, wasted and anaemic, and the abdomen may
be enormously enlarged. There is usually moderate fever, and thin
watery diarrhoea. The caseating glands may liquefy and give rise
to an inflammatory attack which may simulate appendicitis. Limited
masses are amenable to surgical treatment and may be removed,
while in the earlier stages constitutional treatment gives good
results. Tuberculous peritonitis frequently supervenes on this
condition.</p>

<p><i>Lymphadenoma</i> (Hodgkin&rsquo;s Disease), a disease which was first fully
described by Hodgkin in 1832, is characterized by a progressive
enlargement of the lymphatic glands all over the body, and generally
starts in the glands of the neck. The majority of cases occur in young
adults, and preponderate in the male sex. The first symptom is
usually enlargement of a gland in the neck, with generally progressive
growth of the glands in the submaxillary region and axilla. The
inguinal glands are early involved, and after a time the internal
lymph glands follow. The enlargements are at first painless, but
in the later stages symptoms are caused by pressure on the surrounding
organs, and when the disease starts in the deeper structures the
first symptoms may be pain in the chest and cough, pain in the
abdomen, pain and oedema in the legs. The glands may increase
until they are as large as eggs, and later may become firmly adherent
one to another, forming large lobulated tumours. Increase of
growth in this manner in the neck may cause obstructive dyspnoea
and even death. In the majority of cases the spleen enlarges, and
in rare instances lymphoid tumours may be found on its surface.
Anaemia is common and is secondary in character; slight irregular
fever is present, and soon a great and progressive emaciation takes
place. The cases are of two types, the acute cases in which the enlargements
take place rapidly and death may occur in two to
three months, and the chronic cases in which the disease may remain
apparently stationary. In acute lymphadenoma the prognosis is
very unfavourable. Recovery sometimes takes place in the chronic
type of the disease. Early surgical intervention has in some cases
been followed by success. The application of X-rays is a valuable
method of treatment, superficial glands undergoing a rapid diminution
in size. Of drugs arsenic is of the most service, and mercurial
inunction has been recommended by Dreschfeld. Organic extracts
have of late been used in the treatment of lymphadenoma.</p>

<p><i>Glandular Fever</i> is an acute infectious fever, generally occurring in
epidemics, and was first described by E. Pfeiffer in 1889. It usually
affects children and has a tendency to run through all the children of
a family. The incubation period is said to be about 7 days. The
onset is sudden, with pain in the neck and limbs, headache, vomiting,
difficulty in swallowing and high temperature. On the second day, or
sometimes on the first, swelling of the cervical glands is noticed, and
later the posterior cervical, axillary and inguinal glands become
enlarged and tender. In about half the cases the spleen and liver
are enlarged and there is abdominal tenderness. West found the
mesenteric nodes enlarged in 37 cases. Nephritis is an occasional
complication, and constipation is very usual. The disease tends to
subside of itself, and the fever usually disappears after a few days;
the glandular swellings may, however, persist from one to three
weeks. Considerable anaemia has been noticed to follow the illness.
Rest in bed while the glands are enlarged, and cod-liver oil and iron
to meet the anaemia, are the usual treatment.</p>

<p><i>Status lymphaticus</i> (lymphatism) is a condition found in children
and some adults, characterized by an enlargement of the lymphoid
tissues throughout the body and more particularly by enlargement
of the thymus gland. There is a special lowering of the patient&rsquo;s
powers of resistance, and it has been said to account for a number of
cases of sudden death. In all cases of status lymphaticus the thymus
has been found enlarged. At birth the gland (according to Bovaird
and Nicoll) weighs about 6 grammes, and does not increase after
birth. In lymphatism it may weigh from 10 to 50 grammes. The
clinical features are indefinite, and the condition frequently passes
unrecognized during life. In most cases there is no hint of danger
until the fatal syncope sets in, which may be after any slight exertion
or shock, the patient becoming suddenly faint, gasping and cyanosed,
and the heart stopping altogether before the respirations have
ceased. The most trifling causes have brought on fatal issues, such as
a wet pack (Escherich) or a hypodermic injection, or even a sudden
plunge into water though the head is not immersed. The greater
number of deaths occur during the administration of anaesthetics,
which seem peculiarly dangerous to these subjects. When an attack
of syncope takes place no treatment is of any avail.</p>

<p>Virchow, West and Goodhardt have described a form of asthma
in adults which they ascribe to a hypertrophied thymus gland and
term &ldquo;thymic asthma.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Diseases of the Spleen.</i>&mdash;Physiological variations and abnormalities
and absence of the spleen are so rare as to require no comment. The
most usual pathological condition which gives rise to symptoms is
that of <i>wandering spleen</i>, which may or may not be secondary to a
wandering left kidney. It may produce symptoms of dragging and
discomfort, dyspepsia, vomiting and abdominal pain, and sometimes
jaundice (Treves), or the pedicle may become twisted, producing
extremely severe symptoms. The treatment is entirely surgical.
Abscess in the spleen occasionally occurs, usually in association with
infective endocarditis or with general pyaemia. The spleen may be
the seat of primary <i>new growths</i>, but these are rare, and only in a
small portion of cases does it share in the metastatic reproduction of
carcinoma. Infection of the spleen plays a prominent part in many
diseases, such as malaria, typhoid fever, lymphadenoma and
leucaemia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYNCH, PATRICIO<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> (1825-1886) Chilean naval officer, was born
in Valparaiso on the 18th of December 1825, his father being
a wealthy Irish merchant resident in Chile, and his mother,
Carmen Solo de Saldiva, a descendant of one of the best-known
families in the country. Entering the navy in 1837, he took part
in the operations which led to the fall of the dictator, Santa Cruz.
Next, he sought a wider field, and saw active service in the China
War on board the British frigate &ldquo;Calliope.&rdquo; He was mentioned
in despatches for bravery, and received the grade of midshipman
in the British service. Returning to Chile in 1847 he became
lieutenant, and seven years later he received the command of a
frigate, but was deprived of his command for refusing to receive
on board his ship political suspects under arrest. The Spanish
War saw him again employed, and he was successively maritime
prefect of Valparaiso, colonel of National Guards, and, finally,
captain and minister of marine in 1872. In the Chile-Peruvian
War a brilliant and destructive naval raid, led by him, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>169</span>
followed by the final campaign of Chorrillos and Miraflores (1880),
in which he led at first a brigade (as colonel) and afterwards
a division under Baquedano. His services at the battle of
Chorrillos led to his appointment to command the Army of
Occupation in Peru. This difficult post he filled with success,
but his action in putting the Peruvian president, Garcia Calderon,
under arrest excited considerable comment. His last act was
to invest Iglesias with supreme power in Peru, and he returned
to his own country in 1883. Promoted rear-admiral, he served
as Chilean Minister at Madrid for two years, and died at sea in
1886. Lynch is remembered as one of the foremost of Chile&rsquo;s
naval heroes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYNCHBURG,<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> a city of Campbell county, Virginia, U.S.A.,
on the James river, about 125 m. W. by S. of Richmond. Pop.
(1900) 18,891, of whom 8254 were negroes; (1910) 29,494. It is
served by the Southern, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Norfolk
&amp; Western railways. Its terraced hills command fine views of
mountain, valley and river scenery, extending westward to the
noble Peaks of Otter and lesser spurs of the Blue Ridge about
20 m. distant. On an elevation between Rivermont Avenue and
the James river are the buildings of Randolph-Macon Woman&rsquo;s
college (opened in 1893), which is conducted by a self-perpetuating
board under the auspices of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
South, and is one of the Randolph-Macon system of colleges and
academies (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ashland, Va.</a></span>). In Lynchburg, too, are the
Virginia Christian college (co-educational, 1903), and the
Virginia collegiate and industrial school for negroes. The city
has a public library, well-equipped hospitals, public parks and
the Rivermont Viaduct, 1100 ft. long and 140 ft. high. Lynchburg
is the see of a Protestant Episcopal bishop. Tobacco
of a superior quality and large quantities of coal, iron ore and
granite are produced in the neighbourhood. Good water power
is furnished by the James river, and Lynchburg is one of the
principal manufacturing cities of the state. The boot and shoe
industry was established in 1900, and is much the most important.
In 1905 the city was the largest southern manufacturer of these
articles and one of the largest distributors in the country. The
factory products increased in value from $2,993,551 in 1900 to
$4,905,435 in 1905, or 65.9%.</p>

<p>Lynchburg, named in honour of John Lynch, who inherited
a large tract of land here and in 1757 established a ferry across
the James, was established as a village by Act of Assembly in
1786, was incorporated as a town in 1805, and became a city in
1852. During the Civil War it was an important base of supplies
for the Confederates; on the 16th of June 1864 it was invested
by Major-General David Hunter (1802-1886), but three days
later he was driven away by General Jubal A. Early. In 1908
the city&rsquo;s corporate limits were extended.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYNCH LAW,<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> a term loosely applied to various forms of
executing rough popular justice, or what is thought to be justice,
for the punishment of offenders by a summary procedure, ignoring,
or even contrary to, the strict forms of law. The word
<i>lynching</i> &ldquo;originally signified a whipping for reformatory
purposes with more or less disregard for its legality&rdquo; (Cutler), or
the infliction of minor punishments without recourse to law;
but during and after the Reconstruction Period in the United
States, it came to mean, generally, the summary infliction of
capital punishment. Lynch law is frequently prevalent in
sparsely settled or frontier districts where government is weak
and officers of the law too few and too powerless to enforce law
and preserve order. The practice has been common in all
countries when unsettled frontier conditions existed, or in periods
of threatened anarchy. In what are considered civilized countries
it is now found mainly in Russia, south-eastern Europe and in
America, but it is essentially and almost peculiarly an American
institution. The origin of the name is obscure; different writers
have attempted to trace it to Ireland, to England, to South
Carolina, to Pennsylvania and to Virginia. It is certain that the
name was first used in America, but it is not certain whether it
came from Lynch&rsquo;s Creek, South Carolina, where summary
justice was administered to outlaws, or from Virginia and
Pennsylvania, where men named Lynch were noted for dealing
out summary punishment to offenders.<a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> In Europe early
examples of a similar phenomenon are found in the proceedings
of the Vehmgerichte in medieval Germany, and of Lydford law,
gibbet law or Halifax law, Cowper justice and Jeddart justice in
the thinly settled and border districts of Great Britain; and
since the term &ldquo;lynch law&rdquo; came into colloquial use, it is
loosely employed to cover any case in which a portion of the
community takes the execution of its ideas of justice into its
own hands, irrespective of the legal authorities.</p>

<p>In America during the 18th and 19th centuries the population
expanded westward faster than well-developed civil institutions
could follow, and on the western frontier were always desperadoes
who lived by preying on the better classes. To suppress these
desperadoes, in the absence of strong legal institutions, resort was
continually made to lynch law. There was little necessity for it
until the settlement crossed the Alleghany Mountains, but the
following instances of lynching in the East may be mentioned:
(1) the mistreatment of Indians in New England and the Middle
Colonies in disregard of laws protecting them; (2) the custom
found in various colonies of administering summary justice to
wife-beaters, idlers and other obnoxious persons; (3) the acts of
the Regulators of North Carolina, 1767-1771; (4) the popular
tribunals of the Revolutionary period, when the disaffection
toward Great Britain weakened the authority of the civil
governments and the war replaced them by popular governments,
at a time when the hostilities between &ldquo;Patriots&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Tories&rdquo; were an incentive to extra-legal violence. In the
South, lynching methods were long employed in dealing with
agitators, white and black, who were charged with endeavouring
to excite the slaves to insurrection or to crime against their
masters, and in dealing with anti-slavery agitators generally.</p>

<p>In the West, from the Alleghanies to the Golden Gate, the
pioneer settlers resorted to popular justice to get rid of bands
of outlaws, and to regulate society during that period when
laws were weak or confused, when the laws made in the East
did not suit western conditions, and when courts and officials
were scarce and distant. The Watauga settlements and the
&ldquo;State&rdquo; of Franklin furnished examples of lynch law procedure
almost reduced to organization. Men trained in the rough
school of the wilderness came to have more regard for quick,
ready-made, personal justice than for abstract justice and
statutes; they were educated to defend themselves, to look
to no law for protection or regulation; consequently they
became impatient of legal forms and lawyers&rsquo; technicalities; an
appeal to statute law was looked upon with suspicion, and, if
some personal matter was involved, was likely to result in deadly
private feuds. Thus were formed the habits of thought and
action of the western pioneers. Lynch law, not civil law, cleared
the western forests, valleys and mountain passes of horse and
cattle thieves, and other robbers and outlaws, gamblers and
murderers. This was especially true of California and the
states of the far West. H. H. Bancroft, the historian of <i>Popular
Tribunals</i>, wrote in 1887 that &ldquo;thus far in the history of these
Pacific States far more has been done toward righting wrongs
and administering justice outside the pale of law than within
it.&rdquo; However, the lack of regard for law fostered by the conditions
described led to a survival of the lynching habit after
the necessity for it passed away. In parts of the Southern states,
where the whites are few and greatly outnumbered by the
blacks, certain of the conditions of the West have prevailed,
and since emancipation released the blacks from restraint
many of the latter have been lawless and turbulent. The
Reconstruction, by giving to the blacks temporary political
supremacy, increased the friction between the races, and greatly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span>
deepened prejudice. The numerous protective societies of
whites, 1865-1876, culminating in the Ku Klux movement,
may be described as an application of lynch law. With the
increase of negro crimes came an increase of lynchings, due to
prejudice, to the fact that for some time after Reconstruction
the governments were relatively weak, especially in the districts
where the blacks outnumber the whites, to the fact that
negroes nearly always shield criminals of their own race
against the whites, and to the frequent occurrence of the crime
of rape by negro men upon white women.</p>

<p>Since 1882 the Chicago <i>Tribune</i> has collected statistics of
lynching, and some interesting facts may be deduced from these
tables.<a name="fa2k" id="fa2k" href="#ft2k"><span class="sp">2</span></a> During the twenty-two years from 1882 to 1903 inclusive,
the total number of persons lynched in the United States
was 3337, the number decreasing during the last decade; of
these 2385 were in the South and 752 in the North; of those
lynched in the East and West 602 were white and 75 black,
and of those in the South 567 were white and 1985 black.<a name="fa3k" id="fa3k" href="#ft3k"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
Lynchings occur mostly during periods of idleness of the lower
classes; in the summer more are lynched for crimes against
the person and in the winter (in the West) for crimes against
property; the principal causes of lynching in the South are
murder and rape, in the North and West, murder and offences
against property; more blacks than whites were lynched
between 1882 and 1903, the numbers being 2060 negroes, of
whom 40 were women, and 1169 whites, of whom 23 were women;
of the 707 blacks lynched for rape 675 were in the South; 783
blacks were lynched for murder, and 753 of these were in the
South; most of the lynchings of whites were in the West; the
lynching of negroes increased somewhat outside of the South
and decreased somewhat in the South. Lynching decreases
and disappears in a community as the population grows denser
and civil institutions grow stronger; as better communications
and good police make it harder to commit crime; and as public
sentiment is educated to demand legal rather than illegal and
irregular infliction of punishment for even the most horrible
of crimes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYNDHURST, JOHN SINGLETON COPLEY,<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron</span> (1772-1863),
lord chancellor of England, was born at Boston, Massachusetts,
in 1772. He was the son of John Singleton Copley,
the painter. He was educated at a private school and Cambridge
university, where he was second wrangler and fellow of Trinity.
Called to the bar at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn in 1804, he gained a considerable
practice. In 1817 he was one of the counsel for Dr J.
Watson, tried for his share in the Spa Fields riot. On this
occasion Copley so distinguished himself as to attract the attention
of Castlereagh and other Tory leaders, under whose patronage
he entered parliament as member for Yarmouth in the Isle
of Wight. He afterwards sat for Ashburton, 1818-1826, and
for Cambridge university 1826-1827. He was solicitor-general
in 1819, attorney-general in 1824, master of the rolls in 1826
and lord chancellor in 1827, with the title of Lord Lyndhurst.
Before being taken up by the Tories, Copley was a man of the
most advanced views, a republican and Jacobin; and his
accession to the Tories excited a good deal of comment, which
he bore with the greatest good humour. He gave a brilliant and
eloquent but by no means rancorous support to all the reactionary
measures of his chief. The same year that he became
solicitor-general he married the beautiful and clever widow of
Lieut.-Colonel Charles Thomas of the Coldstream Guards, and
began to take a conspicuous place in society, in which his noble
figure, his ready wit and his never-failing <i>bonhomie</i> made him
a distinguished favourite.</p>

<p>As solicitor-general he took a prominent part in the trial of
Queen Caroline. To the great Liberal measures which marked
the end of the reign of George IV. and the beginning of that
of William IV. he gave a vigorous opposition. He was lord
chief baron of the exchequer from 1831 to 1834. During the
Melbourne administration from 1835 to 1841 he figured conspicuously
as an obstructionist in the House of Lords. In these
years it was a frequent practice with him, before each prorogation
of parliament, to entertain the House with a &ldquo;review of the
session,&rdquo; in which he mercilessly attacked the Whig government.
His former adversary Lord Brougham, disgusted at his treatment
by the Whig leaders, soon became his most powerful ally in
opposition; and the two dominated the House of Lords.
Throughout all the Tory governments from 1827 Lyndhurst
held the chancellorship (1827-1830 and 1834-1835); and in
the Peel administration (1841-1846) he resumed that office for
the last time. As Peel never had much confidence in Lyndhurst,
the latter did not exert so great an influence in the cabinet as
his position and experience entitled him to do. But he continued
a loyal member of the party. As in regard to Catholic
emancipation, so in the agitation against the corn laws, he
opposed reform till his chief gave the signal for concession, and
then he cheerfully obeyed. After 1846 and the disintegration
of the Tory party consequent on Peel&rsquo;s adoption of free trade,
Lord Lyndhurst was not so assiduous in his attendance in
parliament. Yet he continued to an extreme old age to take
a lively interest in public affairs, and occasionally to astonish
the country by the power and brilliancy of his speeches. That
which he made in the House of Lords on the 19th of June 1854,
on the war with Russia, made a sensation in Europe; and
throughout the Crimean War he was a strong advocate of the
energetic prosecution of hostilities. In 1859 he denounced with
his old energy the restless ambition of Napoleon III. When
released from office he came forward somewhat as the advocate
of liberal measures. His first wife had died in 1834, and in
August 1837 he had married Georgina, daughter of Lewis Goldsmith.
She was a Jewess; and it was therefore natural that
he strenuously supported the admission of Jews into parliament.
He also advocated women&rsquo;s rights in questions of divorce. At
the age of eighty-four he passed the autumn at Dieppe, &ldquo;helping
to fly paper kites, and amusing himself by turns with the writings
of the Greek and Latin fathers on divorce and the amorous
novels of Eugene Sue.&rdquo; His last speech, marked by &ldquo;his wonted
brilliancy and vigour,&rdquo; was delivered in the House of Lords at
the age of eighty-nine. He died in London on the 12th of
October 1863. He left no male issue and the title became
extinct.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYNDSAY, SIR DAVID<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1490-<i>c.</i> 1555), Scottish poet, was
the son of David Lyndsay of the Mount, near Cupar-Fife, and
of Garmylton, near Haddington. His place of birth and his
school are undetermined. It is probable that his college life
was spent at St Andrews university, on the books of which
appears an entry &ldquo;Da Lindesay&rdquo; for the session 1508-1509.
He was engaged at court, first as an equerry, then as an &ldquo;usher&rdquo;
to the young Prince James, afterwards James V. In 1522 he
married Janet Douglas, a court seamstress, and seven years
later was appointed Lyon King of Arms, and knighted. He
was several times engaged in diplomatic business (twice on
embassies abroad&mdash;to the Netherlands and France), and he was,
in virtue of his heraldic office, a general master of ceremonies.
After the death of James V., in 1542, he continued to sit in
parliament as commissioner for Cupar-Fife; and in 1548 he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
was member of a mission to Denmark which obtained certain
privileges for Scottish merchants. There is reason to believe
that he died in or about 1555.</p>

<p>Most of Lyndsay&rsquo;s literary work, by which he secured great
reputation in his own day and by which he still lives, was written
during the period of prosperity at court. In this respect he is
unlike his predecessor Gavin Douglas (<i>q.v.</i>), who forsook literature
when he became a politician. The explanation of the difference
is partly to be found in the fact that Lyndsay&rsquo;s muse was more
occasional and satirical, and that the time was suitable to the
exercise of his special gifts. It is more difficult to explain how
he enjoyed a freedom of speech which is without parallel even
in more secure times. He chastised all classes, from his royal
master to the most simple. There is no evidence that he abjured
Catholicism; yet his leading purpose was the exposure of its
errors and abuses. His aid was readily accepted by the reforming
party, and by their use of his work he shared with their leaders
throughout many generations a reputation which is almost
exclusively political and ecclesiastical.</p>

<p>Lyndsay&rsquo;s longer poems are <i>The Dreme</i> (1134 lines), <i>The
Testament and Complaynt of the Papynago</i> (1190 lines), <i>The
Testament of Squyer Meldrum</i> (1859 lines), <i>Ane Dialog betwix
Experience and ane Courteour of the Miserabyll Estait of the
World</i> (6333 lines), and <i>Ane Pleasant Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis</i>
(over 4000 lines). These represent, with reasonable completeness,
the range of Lyndsay&rsquo;s literary talent. No single poem can give
him a chief place, though here and there, especially in the last,
he gives hints of the highest competence. Yet the corporate
effect of these pieces is to secure for him the allowance of more
than mere intellectual vigour and common sense. There is in
his craftsmanship, in his readiness to apply the traditional
methods to contemporary requirements, something of that
accomplishment which makes even the second-rate man of letters
interesting.</p>

<p>Lyndsay, the last of the Makars, is not behind his fellow-poets
in acknowledgment to Chaucer. As piously as they, he reproduces
the master&rsquo;s forms; but in him the sentiment and outlook
have suffered change. His nearest approach to Chaucer is in
<i>The Testament of Squyer Meldrum</i>, which recalls the sketch of
the &ldquo;young squire&rdquo;; but the reminiscence is verbal rather than
spiritual. Elsewhere his memory serves him less happily, as
when he describes the array of the lamented Queen Magdalene
in the words which Chaucer had applied to the eyes of his
wanton Friar. So too, in the <i>Dreme</i>, the allegorical tradition
survives only in the form. &ldquo;Remembrance&rdquo; conducts the poet
over the old-world itinerary, but only to lead him to speculation
on Scotland&rsquo;s woes and to an &ldquo;Exhortatioun to the Kingis
Grace&rdquo; to bring relief. The tenor is well expressed in the motto
from the Vulgate&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Prophetias nolite spernere. Omnia autem
probate: quod bonum est tenete.</i>&rdquo; This didactic habit is freely
exercised in the long <i>Dialog</i> (sometimes called the <i>Monarche</i>),
a universal history of the medieval type, in which the falls of
princes by corruption supply an object lesson to the unreformed
church of his day. The <i>Satyre</i> is more direct in its attack on
ecclesiastical abuse; and its dramatic form permits more
lively treatment. This piece is of great historical interest, being
the only extant example of a complete Scottish morality. It
is in respect of literary quality Lyndsay&rsquo;s best work, and in
dramatic construction and delineation of character it holds a
high place in this <i>genre</i>. The farcical interludes (in places too
coarse for modern taste) supply many touches of genuine comedy;
and throughout the play there are passages, as in the speeches of
Veritie in the First Part and of Dame Chastitie in the &ldquo;Interlude
of the Sowtar and the Taylor,&rdquo; in which word and line are happily
conceived. The <i>Testament of the Papyngo</i> (popinjay), drawn in
the familiar medieval manner, is another tract for the time,
full of admonition to court and clergy. Of his shorter pieces,
<i>The Complaynt and Publict Confessions of the Kingis Auld Hound,
callit Bagsche, directit to Bawtie, the Kingis best belovit Dog, and
his companyeonis</i>, and the <i>Answer to the Kingis Flyting</i> have a
like pulpit resonance. The former is interesting as a forerunner
of Burns&rsquo;s device in the &ldquo;Twa Dogs.&rdquo; The <i>Deploratioun of the
Deith of Queen Magdalene</i> is in the extravagant style of commemoration
illustrated in Dunbar&rsquo;s Elegy on the Lord Aubigny.
The <i>Justing betwix James Watsoun and Jhone Barbour</i> is a
contribution to the popular taste for boisterous fun, in spirit,
if not in form, akin to the <i>Christis Kirk on the Grene</i> series;
and indirectly, with Dunbar&rsquo;s <i>Turnament</i> and <i>Of ane Blak-Moir</i>,
a burlesque of the courtly tourney. Lyndsay approaches Dunbar
in his satire <i>The Supplicatioun in contemptioun of syde taillis</i>
(&ldquo;wide&rdquo; trains of the ladies), which recalls the older poet&rsquo;s
realistic lines on the filthy condition of the city streets. In
Lyndsay&rsquo;s <i>Descriptioun of Pedder Coffeis</i> (pedlars) we have an
early example of the studies in vulgar life which are so plentiful
in later Scottish literature. In <i>Kitteis Confessioun</i> he returns,
but in more sprightly mood, to his attack on the church.</p>

<p>In Lyndsay we have the first literary expression in Scotland
of the Renaissance. His interest lies on the theological side
of the revival; he is in no sense a humanist, and he is indifferent
to the artistic claims of the movement. Still he appeals to the
principle which is fundamental to all. He demands first-hand
impression. He feels that men must get their lesson direct,
not from intermediaries who understand the originals no more
&ldquo;than they do the ravyng of the rukis.&rdquo; Hence his persistent
plea for the vernacular, nowhere more directly put than in the
<i>Dialog</i>, in the &ldquo;Exclamatioun to the Redar, toucheyng the
wrytting of the vulgare and maternall language.&rdquo; Though he is
concerned only in the theological and ecclesiastical application
of this, he undoubtedly stimulated the use of the vernacular
in a Scotland which in all literary matters beyond the concern
of the irresponsible poet still used the <i>lingua franca</i> of Europe.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A complete edition of Lyndsay&rsquo;s poetical works was published by
David Laing in 3 vols. in 1879. This was anticipated during the
process of preparation by a cheaper edition (slightly expurgated) by
the same editor in 1871 (2 vols.). The E.E.T.S. issued the first
part of a complete edition in 1865 (ed. F. Hall). Five parts have
appeared, four edited by F. Hall, the fifth by J. A. H. Murray. For
the bibliography see Laing&rsquo;s 3 vol. edition, <i>u.s.</i> iii. pp. 222 et seq.,

Smith&rsquo;s <i>Transition Period</i> (1900), and J. H. Millar&rsquo;s <i>Literary History
of Scotland</i> (1903). A professional work prepared by Lyndsay in the
Lyon Office, entitled the <i>Register of Scottish Arms</i> (now preserved in
MS. in the Advocates&rsquo; Library), was printed in 1821 and reprinted in
1878. It remains the most authoritative document on Scottish
heraldry.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYNEDOCH, THOMAS GRAHAM,<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Baron</span> (1748-1843),
British general, was the son of Thomas Graeme, laird of Balgowan,
and was born on the 19th of October 1748. He was
educated by private tutors, among whom was James Macpherson
(<i>q.v.</i>), and was a gentleman commoner of Christ Church, Oxford,
between 1766 and 1768. He then travelled on the continent of
Europe, and in 1772 unsuccessfully contested a parliamentary
seat in Perthshire. In 1774 he married a daughter of the ninth
Lord Cathcart, and took a house in the Leicestershire hunting
country. After a few years, owing to the state of his wife&rsquo;s
health, Graham was compelled to live mainly in the south of
Europe, though while at home he was a prominent sportsman
and agriculturist. In 1787 he bought the small estate of Lynedoch
or Lednock, a few miles from Perth. In 1791 his wife died
in the Mediterranean, off Hyères. Graham tried to find distraction
in renewed travels, and during his wanderings fell in
with Lord Hood&rsquo;s fleet on its way to Toulon. He joined it as a
volunteer, served on Lord Mulgrave&rsquo;s staff during the British
occupation of Toulon, and returned, after the failure of the expedition,
to Scotland, where he organized a regiment of infantry,
the 90th Foot, Perthshire Volunteers (now 2nd Battalion Scottish
Rifles). Graham&rsquo;s men were the first regiment in the army to be
equipped and trained wholly as light infantry, though they were
not officially recognized as such for many years. In the same
year (1794) Graham became member of parliament, in the Whig
interest, for the county of Perth. He saw some active service in
1795 in &ldquo;conjunct expeditions&rdquo; of the army and navy, and in
1796, being then a brevet colonel, he was appointed British commissioner
at the headquarters of the Austrian army in Italy. He
took part in the operations against Napoleon Bonaparte, was shut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span>
up in Mantua with Würmser&rsquo;s army, escaped in disguise, and
after many adventures reached the relieving army of Alvinzi
just before the battle of Rivoli. On returning to his regiment he
served in more &ldquo;conjunct&rdquo; expeditions, in one of which, at
Messina, he co-operated with Nelson, and in 1799 he was sent as
brigadier-general to invest the fortress of Valetta, Malta. He
blockaded the place for two years, and though Major-General
Pigot arrived shortly before the close of the blockade and
assumed command, the conquest of Malta stands almost wholly
to the credit of Graham and his naval colleague Sir Alexander
Ball. In 1801 Graham proceeded to Egypt, where his regiment
was engaged in Abercromby&rsquo;s expedition, but arrived too late
to take part in any fighting. He took the opportunity afforded
by the peace of Amiens to visit Turkey, Austria, Germany and
France, and only resumed command of his regiment in 1804.
When the latter was ordered to the West Indies he devoted
himself to his duties as a member of parliament. He sat for
Perthshire until 1807, when he was defeated, as he was again
in 1812. Graham was with Moore in Sweden in 1808 and in
Spain 1808-1809, and was present at his death at the battle of
Corunna. In 1809 he became a major-general, and after taking
part in the disastrous Walcheren expedition he was promoted
lieutenant-general and sent to Cadiz (1810).</p>

<p>In 1811, acting in conjunction with the Spanish army under
General la Peña (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Peninsular War</a></span>), he took the offensive,
and won the brilliant action of Barossa (5th of March). The
victory was made barren of result by the timidity of the Spanish
generals. The latter nevertheless claimed more than their share
of the credit, and Graham answered them with spirit. One of
the Spanish officers he called out, fought and disarmed, and after
refusing with contempt the offer of a Spanish dukedom, he
resigned his command in the south and joined Wellington in
Portugal. His seniority as lieutenant-general made him second
in command of Wellington&rsquo;s army. He took part in the siege of
Ciudad Rodrigo, and commanded a wing of the army in the siege
of Badajoz and the advance to Salamanca. In July 1812, his
eyesight becoming seriously impaired, he went home, but rejoined
in time to lead the detached wing of the army in the wide-ranging
man&oelig;uvre which culminated in the battle of Vittoria.
Graham was next entrusted with the investment and siege of
San Sebastian, which after a desperate defence fell on the 9th of
September 1813. He then went home, but in 1814 accepted the
command of a corps to be despatched against Antwerp. His
assault on Bergen op Zoom was, however, disastrously repulsed
(3rd of February 1814).</p>

<p>At the peace Graham retired from active military employment.
He was created Baron Lynedoch of Balgowan in the peerage of
the United Kingdom, but refused the offered pension of £2000
a year. In 1813 he proposed the formation of a military club
in London, and though Lord St Vincent considered such an
assemblage of officers to be unconstitutional, Wellington supported
it and the officers of the army and navy at large received
the idea with enthusiasm. Lynedoch&rsquo;s portrait, by Sir T.
Lawrence, is in possession of this club, the (Senior) United
Service. In his latter years he resumed the habits of his youth,
travelling all over Europe, hunting with the Pytchley so long as
he was able to sit his horse, actively concerned in politics and
voting consistently for liberal measures. At the age of ninety-two
he hastened from Switzerland to Edinburgh to receive
Queen Victoria when she visited Scotland after her marriage.
He died in London on the 18th of December 1843. He had been
made a full general in 1821, and at the time of his death was a
G.C.B., Colonel of the 1st (Royal Scots) regiment, and governor
of Dumbarton Castle.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYNN,<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> a city and seaport of Essex county, Massachusetts,
9 m. N.E. of Boston, on the N. shore of Massachusetts Bay.
Pop. (1900) 68,513, of whom 17,742 were foreign-born (6609
being English Canadians, 5306 Irish, 1527 English and 1280
French Canadians), and 784 were negroes; (1910 census)
89,336. It is served by the Boston &amp; Maine and the Boston,
Revere Beach &amp; Lynn railways, and by an interurban electric
railway, and has an area of 10.85 sq. m. The business part is
built near the shore on low, level ground, and the residential
sections are on the higher levels. Lynn Woods, a beautiful park,
covers more than 2000 acres. On the shore, which has a fine
boulevard, is a state bath house. The city has a handsome city
hall, a free public library, founded in 1862, a soldiers&rsquo; monument
and two hospitals. Lynn is primarily a manufacturing city.
The first smelting works in New England were established here
in 1643. More important and earlier was the manufacture of
boots and shoes, an industry introduced in 1636 by Philip Kertland,
a Buckingham man; a corporation of shoemakers existed
here in 1651, whose papers were lost in 1765. There were many
court orders in the seventeenth century to butchers, tanners,
bootmakers and cordwainers; and the business was made
more important by John Adam Dagyr (d. 1808), a Welshman
who came here in 1750 and whose work was equal to the best in
England. In 1767 the output was 80,000 pairs; in 1795 about
300,000 pairs of women&rsquo;s shoes were made by 600 journeymen
and 200 master workmen. The product of women&rsquo;s shoes had
become famous in 1764, and about 1783 the use of morocco had
been introduced by Ebenezer Breed. In 1900 and 1905 Lynn
was second only to Brockton among the cities of the United
States in the value of boots and shoes manufactured, and outranked
Brockton in the three allied industries, the manufacture
of boots and shoes, of cut stock and of findings. In the value of its
total manufactured product Lynn ranked second to Boston in
the state in 1905, having been fifth in 1900; the total number of
factories in 1905 was 431; their capital was $23,139,185; their
employees numbered 21,540; and their product was valued at
$55,003,023 (as compared with $39,347,493 in 1900). Patent
medicines and compounds and the manufacture of electrical
machinery are prominent industries. The Lynn factories of the
General Electric Company had in 1906 an annual product worth
between $15,000,000 and $20,000,000. The foreign export of
manufactured products is estimated at $5,000,000 a year.</p>

<p>Lynn was founded in 1629 and was called Saugus until 1637,
when the present name was adopted, from Lynn Regis, Norfolk,
the home of the Rev. Samuel Whiting (1597-1679), pastor at
Lynn from 1636 until his death. From Lynn Reading was
separated in 1644, Lynnfield in 1782, Saugus in 1815, and, after
the incorporation of the city of Lynn in 1850, Swampscott in
1852, and in 1853 Nahant, S. of Lynn, on a picturesque peninsula
and now a fashionable summer resort.</p>

parliamentary division of Devonshire, England, on the
Bristol Channel; 17 m. E. of Ilfracombe, served by the Lynton
light railway, which joins the South Western and Great Western
lines at Barnstaple. Both are favoured as summer resorts.
Lynmouth stands where two small streams, the East Lyn and
West Lyn, flow down deep and well-wooded valleys to the sea.
Lynton is on the cliff-edge, 430 ft. above. A lift connects the
villages. The industries are fishing and a small coasting trade.
Not far off are the Doone Valley, part of the vale of the East Lyn,
here called Badgeworthy water, once the stronghold of a notorious
band of robbers and famous through R. D. Blackmore&rsquo;s novel
<i>Lorna Doone</i>; Watersmeet, where two streams, the Tavy and
Walkham, join amid wild and beautiful scenery; and the
Valley of Rocks, a narrow glen strewn with immense boulders.
Lynton is an urban district, with a population (1901) of 1641.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYNX<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> (Lat. <i>Lynx</i>, Gr. <span class="grk" title="lynx">&#955;&#973;&#947;&#958;</span>, probably connected with <span class="grk" title="leuosein">&#955;&#949;&#973;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>,
to see), a genus of mammals of the family <i>Felidae</i>, by some
naturalists regarded only as a subgenus or section of the typical
genus <i>Felis</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carnivora</a></span>). As an English word (lynx) the name
is used of any animal of this group. It is not certain to which
of these, if to any of them, the Greek name <span class="grk" title="lynx">&#955;&#973;&#947;&#958;</span> was especially
applied, though it was more probably the caracal (<i>q.v.</i>) than any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span>
of the northern species. The so-called lynxes of Bacchus were
generally represented as resembling leopards rather than any of
the species now known by the name. Various fabulous properties
were attributed to the animal, whatever it was, by the ancients,
that of extraordinary powers of vision, including ability to see
through opaque substances, being one; whence the epithet
&ldquo;lynx-eyed,&rdquo; which has survived to the present day.</p>

<p>Lynxes are found in the northern and temperate regions of
both the Old and New World; they are smaller than leopards,
and larger than true wild cats, with long limbs, short stumpy tail,
ears tufted at the tip, and pupil of the eye linear when contracted.
Their fur is generally long and soft, and always longish upon
the cheeks. Their colour is light brown or grey, and generally
spotted with a darker shade. The naked pads of the feet are
more or less covered by the hair that grows between them. The
skull and skeleton do not differ markedly from those of the other
cats. Their habits are exactly those of the other wild cats. Their
food consists of any mammals or birds which they can overpower.
They commit extensive ravages upon sheep and poultry. They
generally frequent rocky places and forests, being active climbers,
and passing much of their time among the branches of the trees.
Their skins are of considerable value in the fur trade. The
northern lynx (<i>L. lynx</i> or <i>L. borealis</i>) of Scandinavia, Russia,
northern Asia, and till lately the forest regions of central Europe,
has not inhabited Britain during the historic period, but its
remains have been found in cave deposits of Pleistocene age.
Dr W. T. Blanford says that the characters on which E. Blyth
relied in separating the Tibetan lynx (<i>L. isabellinus</i>) from the
European species are probably due to the nature of its habitat
among rocks, and that he himself could find no constant character
justifying separation. The pardine lynx (<i>L. pardinus</i>) from
southern Europe is a very handsome species; its fur is rufous
above and white beneath.</p>

<p>Several lynxes are found in North America; the most northerly
has been described as the Canadian lynx (<i>L. canadensis</i>); the
bay lynx (<i>L. rufus</i>), with a rufous coat in summer, ranges south
to Mexico, with spotted and streaked varieties&mdash;<i>L. maculatus</i>
in Texas and southern California, and <i>L. fasciatus</i> in Washington
and Oregon. The first three were regarded by St George Mivart
as local races of the northern lynx. A fifth form, the plateau
lynx (<i>L. baileyi</i>), was described by Dr C. H. Merriam in 1890, but
the differences between it and the bay lynx are slight and
unimportant.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYON, MARY MASON<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> (1797-1849), American educationalist,
was born on the 28th of February 1797 on a farm near Buckland,
Franklin county, Massachusetts. She began to teach when she
was seventeen, and in 1817, with the earnings from her spinning
and weaving, she went to Sanderson Academy, Ashfield. She
supported herself there, at Amherst Academy, where she spent
one term, and at the girls&rsquo; school in Byfield, established in 1819
by Joseph Emerson (1777-1833), where she went in 1821, by
teaching in district schools and by conducting informal normal
schools. In 1822-1824 she was assistant principal of Sanderson
Academy, and then taught in Miss Zilpah P. Grant&rsquo;s Adams
Female Academy, in Londonderry (now Derry), N.H. This
school had only summer sessions, and Miss Lyon spent her
winters in teaching, especially at Buckland and at Ashfield,
and in studying chemistry and natural science with Edward
Hitchcock, the geologist. In 1828-1834 she taught in Miss Grant&rsquo;s
school, which in 1828 had been removed to Ipswich, and for two
years managed the school in Miss Grant&rsquo;s absence. In 1828-1830
she had kept up her winter &ldquo;normal&rdquo; school at Buckland,
and this was the beginning of her greater plan, &ldquo;a permanent
institution consecrated to the training of young women for
usefulness ... designed to furnish every advantage which the
state of education in this country will allow ... to put within
reach of students of moderate means such opportunities that
none can find better.&rdquo; She was assisted by Dr Hitchcock,
and her own mystical enthusiasm and practical common sense
secured for her plan ready financial support. In 1835 a site
was selected near the village of South Hadley and Mount Holyoke;
in 1836 the school was incorporated as Mount Holyoke Female
Seminary; and on the 8th of November 1837 it opened with
Mary Lyon as principal, and, as assistant, Miss Eunice Caldwell,
afterwards well known as Mrs J. P. Cowles of Ipswich Academy.
Miss Lyon died at Mount Holyoke on the 5th of March 1849,
having served nearly twelve years as principal of the seminary,
on a salary of $200 a year. From her work at Holyoke sprang
modern higher education for women in America.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYON, NATHANIEL<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> (1818-1861), American soldier, was born
in Ashford, Connecticut, on the 14th of July 1818, and graduated
at West Point in 1841. He was engaged in the Seminole War and
the war with Mexico, won the brevet of captain for his gallantry
at Contreras and Churubusco, and was wounded in the assault
on the city of Mexico. In 1850, while serving in California, he conducted
a successful expedition against the Indians. He was
promoted captain in 1851, and two years later was ordered to the
East, when he became an ardent opponent of &ldquo;States&rsquo; Rights&rdquo;
and slavery. He was stationed in Kansas and in Missouri on the
eve of the Civil War. In Missouri not only was sentiment divided,
but the two factions were eager to resort to force long before they
were in the other border states. Lyon took an active part in
organizing the Union party in Missouri, though greatly hampered,
at first by the Federal government which feared to provoke
hostilities, and afterwards by the military commander of the
department, General W. S. Harney. On Harney&rsquo;s removal in
April 1861, Lyon promptly assumed the command, called upon
Illinois to send him troops, and mustered the Missouri contingent
into the United States&rsquo; service. He broke up the militia camp at
St Louis established by the secessionist governor of Missouri, Claiborne
F. Jackson, and but for the express prohibition of Harney,
who had resumed the command, would have proceeded at once to
active hostilities. In all this Lyon had co-operated closely with
Francis P. Blair, Jr., who now obtained from President Lincoln
the definitive removal of Harney and the assignment of Lyon to
command the Department of the West, with the rank of brigadier-general.
On Lyon&rsquo;s refusal to accede to the Secessionists&rsquo; proposal
that the state should be neutral, hostilities opened in earnest,
and Lyon, having cleared Missouri of small hostile bands in the
central part of the state, turned to the southern districts, where
a Confederate army was advancing from the Arkansas border.
The two forces came to action at Wilson&rsquo;s Creek on the 10th of
August 1861. The Union forces, heavily outnumbered, were
defeated, and Lyon himself was killed while striving to rally
his troops. He bequeathed almost all he possessed, some
$30,000, to the war funds of the national government.</p>

an important part in purely Cornish tradition and folk-lore.

without a suggestion of disbelief the flourishing state of Lyonnesse,
and its sudden disappearance beneath the sea. The
legend may be a greatly exaggerated version of some actual
subsidence of inhabited land. There is also a very ancient local
tradition, apparently independent of the story of Lyonnesse,
that the Scilly Islands formed part of the Cornish mainland

<p><span class="bold">LYONS, EDMUND LYONS,<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron</span> (1790-1858), British
admiral, was born at Burton, near Christchurch, Hampshire,
on the 21st of November 1790. He entered the navy, and served
in the Mediterranean, and afterwards in the East Indies, where in
1810 he won promotion by distinguished bravery. He became
post-captain in 1814, and in 1826 commanded the &ldquo;Blonde&rdquo;
frigate at the blockade of Navarino, and took part with the
French in the capture of Kasteo Morea. Shortly before his ship
was paid off in 1835 he was knighted. From 1840 till 1853 Lyons
was employed on the diplomatic service, being successively
minister to Greece, Switzerland and Sweden. On the outbreak
of the war with Russia he was appointed second in command of
the British fleet in the Black Sea under Admiral Dundas, whom
he succeeded in the chief command in 1854. As admiral of the
inshore squadron he had the direction of the landing of the troops
in the Crimea, which he conducted with marvellous energy and
despatch. According to Kinglake, Lyons shared the &ldquo;intimate
counsels&rdquo; of Lord Raglan in regard to the most momentous
questions of the war, and toiled, with a &ldquo;painful consuming
passion,&rdquo; to achieve the object of the campaign. His principal
actual achievements in battle were two&mdash;the support he rendered
with his guns to the French at the Alma in attacking the left
flank of the Russians, and the bold and brilliant part he took with
his ship the &ldquo;Agamemnon&rdquo; in the first bombardment of the
forts of Sebastopol; but his constant vigilance, his multifarious
activity, and his suggestions and counsels were much more
advantageous to the allied cause than his specific exploits. In
1855 he was created vice-admiral; in June 1856 he was raised
to the peerage with the title of Baron Lyons of Christchurch.
He died on the 23rd of November 1858.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYONS<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> (Fr. <i>Lyon</i>), a city of eastern France, capital of the
department of Rhône, 315 m. S.S.E. of Paris and 218 m. N. by W.
of Marseilles on the Paris-Lyon railway. Pop. (1906) town,
430,186; commune, 472,114. Lyons, which in France is second
only to Paris in commercial and military importance, is situated
at the confluence of the Rhone and the Saône at an altitude of
540 to 1000 ft. above sea-level. The rivers, both flowing south,
are separated on the north by the hill on which lies the populous
working quarter of Croix-Rousse, then by the narrow tongue of
land ending in the Perrache Quarter. The peninsula thus formed
is over 3 m. long and from 650 to 1000 yds. broad. It is traversed
lengthwise by the finest streets of the city, the rue de la République,
the rue de l&rsquo;Hôtel de Ville, and the rue Victor Hugo.
Where it enters Lyons the Saône has on its right the faubourg of
Vaise and on its left that of Serin, whence the ascent is made to
the top of the hill of Croix-Rousse. Farther on, its right bank
is bordered by the scarped heights of Fourvière, St Irénée,
Ste Foy, and St Just, leaving room only for the quays and one
or two narrow streets; this is the oldest part of the city. The
river sweeps in a semicircle around this eminence (410 ft. above
it), which is occupied by convents, hospitals and seminaries,
and has at its summit the famous church of Notre-Dame de
Fourvière, the resort of many thousands of pilgrims annually.</p>

<p>On the peninsula between the rivers, at the foot of the hill of
Croix-Rousse, are the principal quarters of the town: the
Terreaux, containing the hôtel de ville, and the chief commercial
establishments; the wealthy residential quarter, centring round
the Place Bellecour, one of the finest squares in France; and the
Perrache. The Rhone and Saône formerly met on the site of this
quarter, till, in the 18th century, the sculptor Perrache reclaimed
it; on the peninsula thus formed stands the principal railway
station, the Gare de Perrache with the Cours du Midi, the most
extensive promenade in Lyons, stretching in front of it. Here,
too, are the docks of the Saône, factories, the arsenal, gas-works
and prisons. The Rhone, less confined than the Saône, flows
swiftly in a wide channel, broken when the water is low in spring
by pebbly islets. On the right hand it skirts first St Clair, sloping
upwards to Croix-Rousse, and then the districts of Terreaux,
Bellecour and Perrache; on the left it has a low-lying plain,
occupied by the Parc de la Tête d&rsquo;Or and the quarters of Brotteaux
and Guillotière. The park, together with its lake, comprises
some 285 acres, and contains a zoological collection,
botanical and pharmaceutical gardens, and the finest greenhouses
in France, with unique collections of orchids, palm-trees and
<i>Cycadaceae</i>. It is defended from the Rhone by the Quai de la
Tête d&rsquo;Or, while on the east the railway line to Geneva separates
it from the race-course. Brotteaux is a modern residential
quarter. Guillotière to the south consists largely of workmen&rsquo;s
dwellings, bordering wide, airy thoroughfares. To the east
extend the manufacturing suburbs of Villeurbanne and Montchat.
The population, displaced by the demolition of the lofty old
houses and the widening of the streets on the peninsula, migrates
to the left bank of the Rhone, the extension of the city into the
plain of Dauphiné being unhindered.</p>

<p>The Rhone and the Saône are bordered by fine quays and
crossed by 24 bridges&mdash;11 over the Rhone, 12 over the Saône,
and 1 at the confluence. Of these the Pont du Change over
the Saône and the Pont de la Guillotière over the Rhone have
replaced medieval bridges, the latter of the two preserving a
portion of the old structure.</p>

<p>Of the ancient buildings Notre-Dame de Fourvière is the most
celebrated. The name originally applied to a small chapel built
in the 9th century on the site of the old forum (<i>forum
vetus</i>) from which it takes its name. It has been often
<span class="sidenote">Public Buildings.</span>
rebuilt, the chief feature being a modern Romanesque
tower surmounted by a cupola and statue of the Virgin. In
1872 a basilica was begun at its side in token of the gratitude of
the city for having escaped occupation by the German troops.
The building, finished in 1894, consists of a nave without aisles
flanked at each exterior corner by a turret and terminating in
an apse. The façade, the lower half of which is a lofty portico
supported on four granite columns, is richly decorated on its
upper half with statuary and sculpture. Marble and mosaic
have been lavishly used in the ornamentation of the interior and
of the crypt. Round the apse runs a gallery from which, according
to an old custom, a benediction is pronounced upon the town
annually on the 8th of September. From this gallery a magnificent
view of the city and the surrounding country can be
obtained. At the foot of the hill of Fourvière rises the cathedral
of St Jean, one of the finest examples of early Gothic architecture
in France. Begun in the 12th century, to the end of which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>175</span>
transept and choir belong, it was not finished till the 15th
century, the gable and flanking towers of the west front being
completed in 1480. A triple portal surmounted by a line of
arcades and a rose window gives entrance to the church. Two
additional towers, that to the north containing one of the largest
bells in France, rise at the extremities of the transept. The
nave and choir contain fine stained glass of the 13th and 14th
centuries as well as good modern glass. The chapel of St Louis
or of Bourbon, to the right of the nave, is a masterpiece of
Flamboyant Gothic. To the right and left of the altar stand
two crosses preserved since the council of 1274 as a symbol of the
union then agreed upon between the Greek and Latin churches.
Adjoining St Jean is the ancient Manécanterie or singers&rsquo; house,
much mutilated and frequently restored, but still preserving
graceful Romanesque arcades along its front. St Martin d&rsquo;Ainay,
on the peninsula, is the oldest church in Lyons, dating from the
beginning of the 6th century and subsequently attached to a
Benedictine abbey. It was rebuilt in the 10th and 11th centuries
and restored in modern times, and is composed of a nave with four
aisles, a transept and choir terminating in three semicircular
apses ornamented with paintings by Hippolyte Flandrin, a
native of Lyons. The church is surmounted by two towers, one
in the middle of the west front, the other at the crossing; the
four columns supporting the latter are said to have come from
an altar to Augustus. A mosaic of the 12th century, a high altar
decorated with mosaic work and a beautifully carved confessional
are among the works of art in the interior. St Nizier, in
the heart of the city, was the first cathedral of Lyons; and the
crypt in which St Pothinus officiated still exists. The present
church is a Gothic edifice of the 15th century, with the exception
of the porch, constructed by Philibert Delorme, a native of
Lyons, in the 16th century. The Church of St Paul (12th and
15th centuries), situated on the right bank of the Saône, preserves
an octagonal central tower and other portions of Romanesque
architecture; that of St Bonaventure, originally a chapel
of the Cordeliers, was rebuilt in the 15th and 19th centuries.
With the exception of the imposing prefecture, the vast buildings
of the faculties, which are in the Guillotière quarter, and the law
court, the colonnade of which overlooks the Saône from its right
bank, the chief civil buildings are in the vicinity of the Place des
Terreaux. The east side of this square (so called from the
<i>terreaux</i> or earth with which the canal formerly connecting the
Rhone and the Saône hereabouts was filled) is formed by the
hôtel de ville (17th century), the east façade of which, towards
the Grand Theatre, is the more pleasing. The south side of the
square is occupied by the Palais des Arts, built in the 17th century
as a Benedictine convent and now accommodating the school of
fine arts, the museums of painting and sculpture, archaeology
and natural history, and the library of science, arts and industry.
The museums are second in importance only to those of Paris.
The collection of antiquities, rich in Gallo-Roman inscriptions,
contains the bronze tablets discovered in 1528, on which is
engraved a portion of a speech delivered in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 48, by the
emperor Claudius, advocating the admission of citizens of
Gallia Comata to the Roman senate. The &ldquo;Ascension,&rdquo; a
masterpiece of Perugino, is the chief treasure of the art collection,
in which are works by nearly all the great masters. A special
gallery contains the works of artists of Lyons, among whom are
numbered Antoine Berjon, Meissonier, Paul Chenavard, Puvis de
Chavannes. In the Rue de la République, between the Place de
la Bourse and the Place des Cordeliers, each of which contains
one of its highly ornamented fronts, stands the Palais du
Commerce et de la Bourse, the finest of the modern buildings of
Lyons. The Bourse (exchange) has its offices on the ground
floor round the central glass-roofed hall; the upper storeys
accommodate the commercial tribunal, the council of trade
arbitration, the chamber of commerce and the <i>Musée historique
des Tissus</i>, in which the history of the weaving industry is
illustrated by nearly 400,000 examples. In the buildings of the
lycée on the right bank of the Rhone are the municipal library
and a collection of globes, among them the great terrestrial
globe made at Lyons in 1701, indicating the great African lakes.</p>

<p>The Hôtel Dieu, instituted according to tradition in the
beginning of the 6th century by King Childebert, is still one of
the chief charitable establishments in the city. The present
building dates from the 18th century; its façade, fronting the
west quay of the Rhone for over 1000 ft., was begun according
to the designs of Soufflot, architect of the Pantheon at Paris.
The Hospice de la Charité and the military hospital are on the
same bank slightly farther down stream. The Hospice de
l&rsquo;Antiquaille, at Fourvière, occupies the site of the palace of the
praetorian prefects, in which Germanicus, Claudius and Caracalla
were born. Each of these hospitals contains more than 1000
beds. Lyons has many other benevolent institutions, and is
also the centre of the operations of the Société de la Propagation
de la Foi. The chief monuments are the equestrian statue of
Louis XIV. in the Place Bellecour, the monuments of President
Carnot, Marshal Suchet, the physicist André-Marie Ampère, and
those in honour of the Republic and in memory of the citizens of
the department who fell in the war of 1870-71. The most noteworthy
fountain is that in the Place des Terreaux with the
leaden group by Bartholdi representing the rivers on their way
to the ocean.</p>

<p>There are Roman remains&mdash;baths, tombs and the relics of a
theatre&mdash;in the St Just quarter on the right bank of the Saône.
Three ancient aqueducts on the Fourvière level, from Montromant,
Mont d&rsquo;Or and Mont Pilat, can still be traced. Magnificent
remains of the latter work may be seen at St Irénée and
Chaponost. Traces also exist along the Rhone of a subterranean
canal conveying the water of the river to a <i>naumachia</i> (lake for
mimic sea-fights). Agrippa made Lyons the starting-point of
the principal Roman roads throughout Gaul; and it remains
an important centre in the general system of communication
owing to its position on the natural highway from north to
south-eastern France. The Saône above the town and the Rhone
below have large barge and steamboat traffic. The main line
of the Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée railway runs first through the
station at Vaise, on the right bank of the Saône, and thence to
that of Perrache, the chief station in the city. The line next
in importance, that to Geneva, has its station in the Brotteaux
quarter, and the line of the eastern Lyonnais to St Genix d&rsquo;Aoste
has a terminus at Guillotière; both these lines link up with
the Paris-Lyon main line. The railway to Montbrison starts
from the terminus of St Paul in Fourvière and that to Bourg,
Trévoux and the Dombes region from the station of Croix-Rousse.
A less important line to Vaugneray and Mornant has a terminus
at St Just. Besides the extensive system of street tramways,
cable tramways (<i>ficelles</i>) run to the summits of the eminences cf
Croix-Rousse, Fourvière and St Just.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lyons is, next to Paris, the principal fortress of the interior of
France, and, like the capital, possesses a military governor. The
immediate protection of the city is provided for on the east side by a
modern enceinte, of simple trace, in the plain (subsidiary to this is a
group of fairly modern detached forts forming an advanced position
at the village of Bron), and on the west by a line of detached forts, not
of recent design, along the high ground on the right bank of the Saône.
Some older forts and a portion of the old enceinte are still kept up in
the city itself, and two of these forts, Montessuy and Caluire, situated
on the peninsula, serve with their annexes to connect the northern
extremities of the two lines above mentioned. The main line of
defence is as usual the outer fort-ring, the perimeter of which is more
<span class="sidenote">Defence.</span>
than 40 m., and the mean distance from the centre of the
city 6½ m. This naturally divides into four sections. In
the eastern plain, well in advance of the enceinte, eight principal
sites have been fortified, Feyzin, Corbas, St Priest, Genas, Azieu,
Meyzieux, Décines and Chaurant. These form a semicircle from the
lower to the upper reaches of the Rhone. The northern (or north
eastern) section, between the Rhone and the Saône, has forts Neyron
and Vancia as its principal defences; these and their subsidiary
batteries derive some additional support from the forts Montessuy
and Caluire mentioned above. On the north-west side there is a
strong group of works disposed like a redan, of which the salient, fort
Verdun and annexes, is on the high plateau of Mont d&rsquo;Or pointing
northward, and the faces, represented by forts Frêta and Paillet, are
lower down on the spurs of the ridge, facing north-east and north-west
respectively. The south-western section comprises three
principal groups, Bruisson, Côte-Lorette and Montcorin-Champvillard,
the last-named crossing its fire over the Lower Rhone with
Fort Feyzin. Lastly a connecting battery was built near Chapoly in
1895 to close the gap between the north-western and south-western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>176</span>
sections and to command the westward approaches by the valley of
Charbonnières.</p>

<p>Lyons is the headquarters of the XIV. army-corps, the seat of an
archbishop who holds the title of primate of the Gauls and also that
of archbishop of Vienne, and of a prefect, a court of appeal, a court
of assizes, tribunals of commerce and of first instance, and of two
boards of trade arbitration (<i>conseils de prud&rsquo;hommes</i>). It is the
centre of an <i>académie</i> (educational division) and has a university
with faculties of law, letters, science and medicine and pharmacy.
There are also Catholic faculties (<i>facultés libres</i>) of law, theology,
science and letters, three <i>lycées</i>, training colleges for teachers and
numerous minor educational establishments. There are besides
many special schools at Lyons, the more important being the school
of fine arts which was founded in the 18th century to train competent
designers for the textile manufactures, but has also done much for
painting and sculpture; an army medical school, schools of drawing,
agriculture, music, commerce (<i>école supérieure de commerce</i>), weaving,
tanning, watch-making and applied chemistry, and the écoles La
Martinière for free instruction in science and art as applied to
industry. The veterinary school, instituted in 1761, was the first
of its kind in Europe; its laboratory for the study of comparative
physiology is admirably equipped. Besides the <i>Académie des
Sciences, Belles Lettres et Arts</i> (founded in 1700), Lyons possesses
societies of agriculture, natural history, geography, horticulture, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Its trade in silk and silk goods has formed the basis of the prosperity
of Lyons for several centuries. Derived from Italy, this industry
rapidly developed, thanks to the monopoly granted to the
city in 1450 by Charles VII. and to the patronage of
<span class="sidenote">Industry and trade.</span>
Francis I., Henry II. and Henry IV. From time to time
new kinds of fabrics were invented&mdash;silk stuffs woofed with
wool or with gold and silver threads, shawls, watered silks, poplins,
velvets, satinades, moires, &amp;c. In the beginning of the 19th century
J. M. Jacquard introduced his famous loom by which a single workman
was enabled to produce elaborate fabrics as easily as the
plainest web, and by changing the &ldquo;cartoons&rdquo; to make the most
different textures on the same looms. In the 17th century the silk
manufacture employed at Lyons, 9000 to 12,000 looms. After the
revocation of the edict of Nantes the number sank to 3000 or 4000;
but after the Reign of Terror was past it rose again about 1801 to
12,000. Towards the middle of the 19th century the weaving
branch of the industry began to desert Lyons for the surrounding
districts. The city remains the business centre for the trade and
carries on dyeing, printing and other accessory processes. Lyons
disputes with Milan the position of the leading silk market of Europe.
In 1905 the special office (<i>la Condition des soies</i>) which determines
the weight of the silk examined over 4700 tons of silk. France
furnished barely one-tenth of this quantity, two-thirds came from
China and Japan, the rest from Italy and the Levant. The traders
of Lyons re-export seven-twelfths of these silks, the industries of the
town employing the remainder. An almost equal quantity of cotton,
wool and waste-silk threads is mixed with the silk. A few thousand
hand-looms are still worked in the town, more especially producing
the richest materials, 50,000 or 55,000 in the surrounding districts,
and some 33,000 machine looms in the suburbs and neighbouring
departments. Allied industries such as dyeing, finishing and printing,
employ 12,000 workers. Altogether 300,000 workpeople depend
upon the silk industry. In 1905 the total value of the manufacture
was £15,710,000, the chief items being pure silk textures (plain)
£3,336,000; textures of silk mixed with other materials £3,180,000;
silk and foulards £1,152,000; muslins £3,800,000, this product
having increased from £100,000 in 1894. Speaking roughly the raw
material represents half the value, and the value of the labour the
remaining half. About 30% of the silk goods of Lyons finds a
market in France. Great Britain imported them to the value of
over £6,000,000, and the United States to the value of over £1,600,000,
notwithstanding the heavy duty. The dyeing industry and the
manufacture of chemicals have both developed considerably to meet
the requirements of the silk trade. Large quantities of mineral and
vegetable colouring matters are produced and there is besides a large
output of glue, gelatine, superphosphates and phosphorus, all made
from bones and hides, of picric, tartaric, sulphuric and hydrochloric
acids, sulphates of iron and copper, and pharmaceutical and other
chemical products.</p>

<p>Lyons does a large trade in metals, iron, steel and copper, and
utilizes them in the manufacture of iron buildings, framework,
bridges, machinery, railway material, scales, metal cables, pins and
needles, copper-founding and the making of clocks and bronzes.
Gold and silver-working is of importance, especially for embroidery
and articles used in religious ceremonies. Other industries are those
of printing, the manufacture of glass goods, of tobacco (by the state),
the preparation of hides and skins (occupying 20,000 workmen), those
connected with the miller&rsquo;s trade, the manufacture of various forms
of dried flour-paste (macaroni, vermicelli, &amp;c.), brewing, hat-making,
the manufacture of chocolate, and the pork-butcher&rsquo;s industry.
Apart from the dealings in silk and silk goods, trade is in cloth, coal
and charcoal, metals and metal goods, wine and spirits, cheese and
chestnuts. Four miles south-west of Lyons is Oullins (pop. 9859)
which has the important works of the Paris-Lyon railway.</p>

<p>Lyons is the seat of important financial companies; of the Crédit
Lyonnais, which does business to the amount of £200,000,000 annually
in Lyons alone; also of coal and metallurgical companies and gas
companies, the former extending their operations as far as Russia,
the latter lighting numerous towns in France and foreign countries.</p>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;The earliest Gallic occupants of the territory at
the confluence of the Rhone and the Saône were the Segusians.
In 59 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> some Greek refugees from the banks of the Hérault,
having obtained permission of the natives to establish themselves
beside the Croix-Rousse, called their new town by the Gallic
name Lugudunum (<i>q.v.</i>) or Lugdunum; and in 43 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Lucius
Munatius Plancus brought a Roman colony to Fourvières from
Vienne. This settlement soon acquired importance, and was
made by Agrippa the starting-point of four great roads.
Augustus, besides building aqueducts, temples and a theatre,
gave it a senate and made it the seat of an annual assembly
of deputies from the sixty cities of Gallia Comata. At the same
time the place became the Gallic centre for the worship of Rome
and the emperor. Under the emperors the colony of Forum
Vetus and the municipium of Lugdunum were united, receiving
the <i>jus senatus</i>. The town was burnt in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 59 and afterwards
rebuilt in a much finer style with money given by Nero; it was
also adorned by Trajan, Adrian and Antoninus. The martyrdom
of Pothinus and Blandina occurred under Marcus Aurelius
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 177), and some years later a still more savage persecution
of the Christians took place under Septimius Severus, in which
Irenaeus, according to some authors, perished.</p>

<p>After having been ravaged by the barbarians and abandoned
by the empire, Lyons in 478 became capital of the kingdom
of the Burgundians. It afterwards fell into the hands of the
Franks, and suffered severely from the Saracens, but revived
under Charlemagne, and after the death of Charles the Bald
became part of the kingdom of Provence. From 1032 it was a
fief of the emperor of Germany. Subsequently the authority
over the town was a subject of dispute between the archbishops
of Lyons and the counts of Forez; but the supremacy of the
French kings was established under Philip the Fair in 1312. The
citizens were constituted into a commune ruled by freely elected
consuls (1320). In the 13th century two ecclesiastical councils
were held at Lyons&mdash;one in 1245, presided over by Innocent IV.,
at which the emperor Frederick II. was deposed; the second,
the &oelig;cumenical, under the presidency of Gregory X., in 1274,
at which five hundred bishops met. Pope Clement V. was
crowned here in 1305, and his successor, John XXII., elected
in 1316. The Protestants obtained possession of the place
in 1562; their acts of violence were fiercely avenged in 1572
after the St Bartholomew massacre. Under Henry III. Lyons
sided with the League; but it pronounced in favour of Henry IV.
The executions of Henri d&rsquo;Effiat, marquis of Cinq-Mars, and of
François de Thou, who had plotted to overthrow Richelieu,
took place on the Place des Terreaux in 1642. In 1793 the
Royalists and Girondists, powerful in the city, rose against the
Convention, but were compelled to yield to the army of the
republic under General Kellermann after enduring a siege of
seven weeks (October 10). Terrible chastisement ensued: the
name of Lyons was changed to that of Ville-affranchie; the
demolition of its buildings was set about on a wholesale scale;
and vast numbers of the proscribed, whom the scaffold had
spared, were butchered with grape shot. The town resumed
its old name after the fall of Robespierre, and the terrorists in
their turn were drowned in large numbers in the Rhone. Napoleon
rebuilt the Place Bellecour, reopened the churches, and made
the bridge of Tilsit over the Saône between Bellecour and
the cathedral. In 1814 and 1815 Lyons was occupied by the
Austrians. In 1831, 1834, 1849, 1870 and 1871 it was the scene
of violent industrial or political disturbances. In 1840 and 1856
disastrous floods laid waste portions of the city. International
exhibitions were held here in 1872 and 1894, the latter occasion
being marked by the assassination of President Carnot.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYONS, COUNCILS OF.<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> The first Council of Lyons (the
thirteenth general council) met at the summons of Pope Innocent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span>
IV. in June and July of 1245, to deliberate on the conflict
between Church and emperor, on the assistance to be granted
to the Holy Land and the Eastern empire, on measures of
protection against the Tatars, and on the suppression of heresy.
Among the tasks of the council mentioned in the writs of convocation,
the most important, in the eyes of the pope, was that
it should lend him effectual aid in his labours to overthrow the
emperor Frederick II.; and, with this object in view, he had
described the synod as a general council. Since its numbers
were not far in excess of 150 bishops and archbishops, and the
great majority of these came from France, Italy and Spain;
while the schismatic Greeks and the other countries&mdash;especially
Germany, whose interests were so deeply involved&mdash;were but
weakly represented; the ambassador of Frederick, Thaddaeus
of Suessa, contested its oecumenicity in the assembly itself.
The condemnation of the emperor was a foregone conclusion.
The articles of indictment described him as the &ldquo;prince of
tyranny, the destroyer of ecclesiastical dogma, the annihilator
of the faith, the master of cruelty,&rdquo; and so forth; while the
grossest calumnies were treated as approved facts. The objections
of the ambassador, that the accused had not been regularly
cited, that the pope was plaintiff and judge in one, and that
therefore the whole process was anomalous, achieved as little
success as his appeal to the future pontiff and to a truly oecumenical
council. The representatives of the kings of England and
France were equally unfortunate in their claim for a prorogation
of the decision. On the 17th of July the verdict was pronounced
by Innocent IV., excommunicating Frederick and dethroning
him on the grounds of perjury, sacrilege, heresy and felony.
All oaths of fealty sworn to him were pronounced null and void,
and the German princes were commanded to proceed with the
election of a new sovereign. In addition the council enacted
decrees against the growing irregularities in the Church, and
passed resolutions designed to support the Crusaders and revive
the struggle for the Holy Land.</p>

<p>The second Council of Lyons (the fourteenth general council)
met from the 7th of May to the 17th of July 1274, under the
presidency of Pope Gregory X., and was designed to resolve
three problems: to terminate the Greek schism, to decree a
new Crusade, and to counteract the moral corruption among
clerics and laity. The council entered on its third task at a
very late period, with the result that the requisite time for an
adequate deliberation was not available. Nevertheless, on the
1st of November, Gregory was enabled to publish thirty-one
constitutions, which may be taken to represent the fruits of
the synod and its labours. The most important of the enactments
passed is that regulating the papal election. It prescribed
that the new election conducted by the college of cardinals
should be held in conclave (<i>q.v.</i>), and its duration abridged by
progressive simplification of the cardinal&rsquo;s diet. The motive
for this decision, which has maintained its ground in ecclesiastical
law, was given by the circumstances which followed the
death of Clement IV. (1268). The pope felt a peculiar interest
in the Holy Land, from which he was recalled by his elevation
to the pontifical throne. He succeeded in bringing influential
interests to work in the cause; but his scheme of a great enterprise
backed by the whole force of the West came to nothing,
for the day of the Crusades was past. His projected Crusade
was interwoven with his endeavours to end the schism; and
the political straits of the emperor Michael Palaeologus in
Constantinople came to the aid of these aspirations. To ensure
his safety against the attacks of King Charles of Sicily, who
had pledged himself to assist the ex-emperor Baldwin in his
reconquest of the Latin empire, Michael was required to own
the supremacy of the pope in the spiritual domain; while
Gregory, in return, would restrain the Sicilian monarch from his
bellicose policy with regard to the Eastern empire. The ambassadors
of the emperor appeared at the council with letters
acknowledging the Roman pontiff and the confession of faith
previously dispatched from the eternal city, and submitted
similarly-worded declarations from the heads of the Byzantine
Church. One member of the embassy, the Logothete Georgius
Acropolites, was authorized by the emperor to take an oath
in his name, renouncing the schism. In short, the subjection
of the East to the Roman see was completed in the most binding
forms, and the long-desired union seemed at last assured.
Gregory himself did not live to discover its illusory character.
The Council of Lyons was, moreover, of importance for the
German dynastic struggle: for Gregory took the first public
step in favour of Count Rudolph of Habsburg, the king-elect,
by receiving his deputy and denying an audience to the delegate
of the rival claimant, King Alphonso of Castile.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYRE<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="lyra">&#955;&#973;&#961;&#945;</span>), an ancient stringed musical instrument.
The recitations of the Greeks were accompanied by it. Yet
the lyre was not of Greek origin; no root in the language has
been discovered for <span class="grk" title="lyra">&#955;&#973;&#961;&#945;</span>, although the special names bestowed
upon varieties of the instrument are Hellenic. We have to seek
in Asia the birthplace of the genus, and to infer its introduction
into Greece through Thrace or Lydia. The historic heroes
and improvers of the lyre were of the Aeolian or Ionian colonies,
or the adjacent coast bordering on the Lydian empire, while
the mythic masters, Orpheus, Musaeus and Thamyris, were
Thracians. Notwithstanding the Hermes tradition of the
invention of the lyre in Egypt, the Egyptians seem to have
adopted it from Assyria or Babylonia.</p>

<p>To define the lyre, it is necessary clearly to separate it from
the allied harp and guitar. In its primal form the lyre differs
from the harp, of which the earliest, simplest notion is found in
the bow and bowstring. While the guitar (and lute) can be
traced back to the typical &ldquo;nefer&rdquo; of the fourth Egyptian
dynasty, the fretted finger-board of which, permitting the
production of different notes by the shortening of the string,
is as different in conception from the lyre and harp as the flute
with holes to shorten the column of air is from the syrinx or
Pandean pipes. The frame of a lyre consists of a hollow body
or sound-chest (<span class="grk" title="êcheion">&#7968;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span>). From this sound-chest are raised two
arms (<span class="grk" title="pêcheis">&#960;&#942;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>), which are sometimes hollow, and are bent both
outward and forward. They are connected near the top by a
crossbar or yoke (<span class="grk" title="zygon, zygôma">&#950;&#965;&#947;&#972;&#957;, &#950;&#973;&#947;&#969;&#956;&#945;</span>, or, from its having once been a
reed, <span class="grk" title="kalamos">&#954;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span>). Another crossbar (<span class="grk" title="malas, hypolyrion">&#956;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#962;, &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>), fixed on
the sound-chest, forms the bridge which transmits the vibrations
of the strings. The deepest note was the farthest from the
player; but, as the strings did not differ much in length, more
weight may have been gained for the deeper notes by thicker
strings, as in the violin and similar modern instruments, or they
were turned with slacker tension. The strings were of gut (<span class="grk" title="chordê">&#967;&#959;&#961;&#948;&#942;</span>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span>
whence chord). They were stretched between the yoke and
bridge, or to a tailpiece below the bridge. There were two ways
of tuning: one was to fasten the strings to pegs which might
be turned (<span class="grk" title="kollaboi, kollopes">&#954;&#972;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#959;&#953;, &#954;&#972;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#960;&#949;&#962;</span>); the other was to change the
place of the string upon the crossbar; probably both expedients
were simultaneously employed. It is doubtful whether <span class="grk" title="hê chordotonos">&#7969; &#967;&#959;&#961;&#948;&#959;&#964;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>
meant the tuning key or the part of the instrument where
the pegs were inserted. The extensions of the arms above the
yoke were known as <span class="grk" title="kerata">&#954;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>, horns.</p>

<p>The number of strings varied at different epochs, and possibly
in different localities&mdash;four, seven and ten having been favourite
numbers. They were used without a finger-board, no Greek
description or representation having ever been met with that
can be construed as referring to one. Nor was a bow possible,
the flat sound-board being an insuperable impediment. The
plectrum, however (<span class="grk" title="plêktron">&#960;&#955;&#8134;&#954;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span>), was in constant use. It was
held in the right hand to set the upper strings in vibration
(<span class="grk" title="krekein, krouein tô plêktrô">&#954;&#961;&#941;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#957;, &#954;&#961;&#959;&#973;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#960;&#955;&#942;&#954;&#964;&#961;&#8179;</span>); at other times it hung from
the lyre by a ribbon. The fingers of the left hand touched the
lower strings (<span class="grk" title="psallein">&#968;&#940;&#955;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>).</p>

<p>With Greek authors the lyre has several distinct names;
but we are unable to connect these with anything like certainty
to the varieties of the instrument. Chelys
(<span class="grk" title="chelys">&#967;&#941;&#955;&#965;&#962;</span>, &ldquo;tortoise&rdquo;) may mean the smallest
lyre, which, borne by one arm or supported
by the knees, offered in the sound-chest a
decided resemblance to that familiar animal.
That there was a difference between lyre
and cithara (<span class="grk" title="kithara">&#954;&#953;&#952;&#940;&#961;&#945;</span>) is certain, Plato and
other writers separating them. Hermes and
Apollo had an altar at Olympia in common
because the former had invented the lyre
and the latter the cithara. The lyre and
chelys on the one hand, and the cithara
and phorminx on the other, were similar
or nearly identical. Apollo is said to have
carried a golden phorminx.</p>
<div class="author">(A. J. H.)</div>

<p>There are three lines of evidence that
establish the difference between the lyre
and cithara: (1) There are certain vase
paintings in which the name <span class="grk" title="lyra">&#955;&#973;&#961;&#945;</span> accompanies
the drawing of the instrument,
as, for instance, in fig. 2 where the tortoise-shell lyre is
obviously represented.<a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (2) In all legends accounting for the
invention of the lyre, the shell or body of the tortoise is invariably
mentioned as forming the back of the instrument,
whereas the tortoise has never been connected with the cithara.
(3) The lyre is emphatically distinguished as the most suitable
instrument for the musical training of young
men and maidens and as the instrument of
the amateur, whereas the cithara was the
instrument of <i>citharoedus</i> or <i>citharista</i>, professional
performers at the Pythian Games,
at ceremonies and festivals, the former using
his instrument to accompany epic recitations
and odes, the latter for purely instrumental
music. The costume worn by citharoedus
and citharista was exceedingly rich and quite
distinct from any other.<a name="fa2l" id="fa2l" href="#ft2l"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>We find the lyre represented among scenes
of domestic life, in lessons, receptions, at
banquets and in mythological scenes; it is
found in the hands of women no less than
men, and the costume of the performer
is invariably that of an ordinary citizen. Lyres were of
many sizes and varied in outline according to period and
nationality.</p>

<p>We therefore possess irrefutable evidence of identification
in both cases, all of which tallies exactly. Examination of the
construction of the instruments thus <span class="correction" title="amended from indentified">identified</span> reveals the fact
that both possessed characteristics which have persisted throughout
the middle ages to the present day in various instruments
evolved from these two archetypes. The principal feature of
both lyre and cithara was the peculiar method of construction
adopted in the sound-chest, which may be said to have been
almost independent of the outline. In the lyre the sound-chest
consisted of a vaulted back, in imitation of the tortoise, over
which was directly glued a flat sound-board of wood or parchment.
In the cithara (<i>q.v.</i>) the sound-chest was shallower, and
the back and front were invariably connected by sides or ribs.
These two methods of constructing the sound-chests of stringed
instruments were typical, and to one or the other may be referred
every stringed instrument with a neck which can be traced
during the middle ages in miniatures, early printed books, on
monuments and other works of art.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Passing by the story of the discovery of the lyre from a vibrating
tortoise-shell by Hermes, we will glance at the real lyres of Egypt
and Semitic Asia. The Egyptian lyre is unmistakably Semitic.
The oldest representation that has been discovered is in one of the
tombs of Beni Hassan, the date of the painting being in the XIIth
Dynasty, that is, shortly before the invasion of &ldquo;the shepherd kings&rdquo;
(the Hyksos). In this painting, which both Rosellini and Lepsius
have reproduced, an undoubted Semite carries a seven or eight-stringed
lyre, or rather cithara in transition, similar to the <i>rotta</i> of
the middle ages. The instrument has a four-cornered body and an
irregular four-cornered frame above it, and the player carries it
horizontally from his breast, just as a modern Nubian would his
kissar. He plays as he walks, using both hands, a plectrum being in
the right. Practical knowledge of these ancient instruments may be
gained through two remarkable specimens preserved in the museums
of Berlin (fig. 3) and Leiden (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cithara</a></span>). During the rule of the
Hyksos the lyre became naturalized in Egypt, and in the 18th
dynasty it is frequently
depicted, and with finer
grace of form. In the
19th and 20th dynasties
the lyre is sometimes still
more slender, or is quite
unsymmetrical and very
strong, the horns surmounted
by heads of
animals as in the Berlin
one, which has horses&rsquo;
heads at those extremities.
Prokesch copied one
in the ruins of Wadi
Halfa, splendid in blue
and gold, with a serpent
wound round it. The
Egyptians always strung
their lyres fan-shaped,
like the modern Nubian kissar. Their paintings show three to
eight or nine strings, but the painters&rsquo; accuracy may not be
unimpeachable; the Berlin instrument had fifteen. The three-stringed
lyre typified the three seasons of the Egyptian year&mdash;the
water, the green and the harvest; the seven, the planetary system
from the moon to Saturn. The Greeks had the same notion of the
harmony of the spheres.</p>

<p>There is no evidence as to what the stringing of the Greek lyre
was in the heroic age. Plutarch says that Olympus and Terpander
used but three strings to accompany their recitation. As the four
strings led to seven and eight by doubling the tetrachord, so the
trichord is connected with the hexachord or six-stringed lyre depicted
on so many archaic Greek vases. We cannot insist on the
accuracy of this representation, the vase painters being little mindful
of the complete expression of details; yet we may suppose their
tendency would be rather to imitate than to invent a number.
It was their constant practice to represent the strings as being
damped by the fingers of the left hand of the player, after having
been struck by the plectrum which he held in the right hand. Before
the Greek civilization had assumed its historic form, there was likely
to be great freedom and independence of different localities in the
matter of lyre stringing, which is corroborated by the antique use of
the chromatic (half-tone) and enharmonic (quarter-tone) tunings,
pointing to an early exuberance, and perhaps also to an Asiatic bias
towards refinements of intonation, from which came the <span class="grk" title="chroai">&#967;&#961;&#972;&#945;&#953;</span>,
the hues of tuning, old Greek modifications of tetrachords entirely
disused in the classic period. The common scale of Olympus</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:231px; height:44px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img178d.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="noind">remained, a double trichord which had served as the scaffolding
for the enharmonic varieties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>179</span></p>

<p>We may regard the Olympus scale, however, as consisting of two
tetrachords, eliding one interval in each, for the tetrachord, or series
of four notes, was very early adopted as the fundamental principle
of Greek music, and its origin in the lyre itself appears sure. The
basis of the tetrachord is the employment of the thumb and first
three fingers of the left hand to twang as many strings, the little
finger not being used on account of natural weakness. As a succession
of three whole tones would form the disagreeable and untunable
interval of a tritonus, two whole tones and a half-tone were tuned,
fixing the tetrachord in the consonant interval of the perfect fourth.
This succession of four notes being in the grasp of the hand was
called <span class="grk" title="syllabê">&#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#942;</span>, just as in language a group of letters incapable of
further reduction is called syllable. In the combination of two
syllables or tetrachords the modern diatonic scales resemble the
Greek so-called disjunct scale, but the Greeks knew nothing of our
categorical distinctions of major and minor. We might call the
octave Greek scale minor, according to our descending minor form,
were not the keynote in the middle the thumb note of the deeper
tetrachord. The upper tetrachord, whether starting from the keynote
(conjunct) or from the note above (disjunct), was of exactly the
same form as the lower, the position of the semitones being identical.
The semitone was a limma (<span class="grk" title="leimma">&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#956;&#956;&#945;</span>), rather less than the semitone of
our modern equal temperament, the Greeks tuning both the whole
tones in the tetrachord by the same ratio of 8:9, which made the
major third a dissonance, or rather would have done so had they
combined them in what we call harmony. In melodious sequence the
Greek tetrachord is decidedly more agreeable to the ear than the
corresponding series of our equal temperament. And although our
scales are derived from combined tetrachords, in any system of
tuning that we employ, be it just, mean-tone, or equal, they are less
logical than the conjunct or disjunct systems accepted by the Greeks.
But modern harmony is not compatible with them, and could not
have arisen on the Greek melodic lines.</p>

<p>The conjunct scale of seven notes</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:265px; height:43px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img179a.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="noind">attributed to Terpander, was long the norm for stringing and tuning
the lyre. When the disjunct scale</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:263px; height:45px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img179b.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="noind">the octave scale attributed to Pythagoras, was admitted, to preserve
the time-honoured seven strings one note had to be omitted; it was
therefore customary to omit the C, which in Greek practice was a
dissonance. The Greek names for the strings of seven and eight
stringed lyres, the first note being highest in pitch and nearest the
player, were as follows: <i>Nete</i>, <i>Paranete</i>, <i>Paramese</i>; <i>Mese</i>, <i>Lichanos</i>,
<i>Parhypate</i>, <i>Hypate</i>; or <i>Nete</i>, <i>Paranete</i>, <i>Trite</i>, <i>Paramese</i>; <i>Mese</i>,
<i>Lichanos</i>, <i>Parhypate</i>, <i>Hypate</i>&mdash;the last four from Mese to Hypate
being the finger tetrachord, the others touched with the plectrum.
The highest string in pitch was called the last, <span class="grk" title="neatê">&#957;&#949;&#940;&#964;&#951;</span>; the lowest
in pitch was called the highest, <span class="grk" title="hypatê">&#8017;&#960;&#940;&#964;&#951;</span>, because it was, in theory at
least, the longest string. The keynote and thumb string was <span class="grk" title="mesê">&#956;&#941;&#963;&#951;</span>,
middle; the next lower was <span class="grk" title="lichanos">&#955;&#943;&#967;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>, the first finger or lick-finger
string; <span class="grk" title="tritê">&#964;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#951;</span>, the third, being in the plectrum division, was also
known as <span class="grk" title="oxeia">&#8000;&#958;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</span>, sharp, perhaps from the dissonant quality to which
we have referred as the cause of its omission. The plectrum and
finger tetrachords together were <span class="grk" title="diapasôn">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#960;&#945;&#963;&#8182;&#957;</span>, through all; in the disjunct
scale, an octave.</p>

<p>In transcribing the Greek notes into our notation, the absolute
pitch cannot be represented; the relative positions of the semitones
are alone determined. We have already quoted the scale of Pythagoras,
the Dorian or true Greek succession:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:262px; height:47px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img179c.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Shifting the semitone one degree upwards in each tetrachord, we
have the Phrygian</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:267px; height:45px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img179d.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="noind">Another degree gives the Lydian</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:262px; height:51px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img179e.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="noind">which would be our major scale of E were not the keynote A. The
names imply an Asiatic origin. We need not here pursue further the
much-debated question of Greek scales and their derivation; it
will suffice to remark that the outside notes of the tetrachords were
fixed in their tuning as perfect fourths&mdash;the inner strings being, as
stated, in diatonic sequence, or when chromatic two half-tones were
tuned, when enharmonic two quarter-tones, leaving respectively the
wide intervals of a minor and major third, and both impure, to complete
the tetrachord.</p>

birds Of Australia is commonly known, the <i>Menura superba</i> or
<i>M. novae-hollandiae</i> of ornithologists. It was first observed in
1798 in New South Wales, and though called by its finders a
&ldquo;pheasant&rdquo;&mdash;from its long tail&mdash;the more learned of the colony
seem to have regarded it as a bird-of-Paradise.<a name="fa1m" id="fa1m" href="#ft1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a> A specimen
having reached England in 1799, it was described by General
Davies as forming a new genus of birds, in the Linnean Society&rsquo;s
<i>Transactions</i> (vi. p. 207, pl. xxii.), no attempt, however, being
made to fix its systematic place. In 1802 L. P. Vieillot figured
and described it in a supplement to his <i>Oiseaux Dorés</i> as a bird-of-Paradise
(ii. pp. 30 seq., pls. 14-16), from drawings by Sydenham
Edwards, sent him by Parkinson, the manager of the Leverian
Museum. The first to describe any portion of its anatomy was
T. C. Eyton, who in 1841 (<i>Ann. Nat. History</i>, vii. pp. 49-53)
perceived that it was a Passerine bird and that it presented some
points of affinity to the South American genus <i>Pteroptochus</i>.
In 1867 Huxley stated that he was disposed to divide his very
natural assemblage the <i>Coracomorphae</i> (essentially identical
with Eyton&rsquo;s <i>Insessores</i>) into two groups, &ldquo;one containing
<i>Menura</i>, and the other all the other genera which have yet been
examined&rdquo; (<i>Proc. Zool. Soc.</i>, 1867, p. 472)&mdash;a still further step
in advance.<a name="fa2m" id="fa2m" href="#ft2m"><span class="sp">2</span></a> In 1875 A. Newton put forth the opinion in his
article on birds, in the 9th edition of this <i>Encyclopaedia</i>, that
<i>Menura</i> had an ally in another Australian form, <i>Atrichia</i> (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Scrub-Bird</a></span>), which he had found to present peculiarities
hitherto unsuspected, and he regarded them as standing by
themselves, though each constituting a distinct family. This
opinion was partially adopted in the following year by A. H.
Garrod, who (<i>Proc. Zool. Society</i>, 1876, p. 518) formally placed
these two genera together in his group of Abnormal Acromyodian
<i>Oscines</i> under the name of <i>Menurinae</i>; ornithologists now
generally recognize at once the alliance and distinctness of the
families Menuridae and Atrichiidae, and place them together to
form the group <i>Suboscines</i> of the Diacromyodian <i>Passeres</i>.</p>

<p>Since the appearance in 1865 of J. Gould&rsquo;s <i>Handbook to the
Birds of Australia</i>, little important information has been published
concerning the habits of this form, and the account therein
given must be drawn upon for what here follows. Of all birds,
says that author, the <i>Menura</i> is the most shy and hard to procure.
He has been among the rocky and thick &ldquo;brushes&rdquo;&mdash;its usual
haunts&mdash;hearing its loud and liquid call-notes for days together
without getting sight of one. Those who wish to see it must
advance only while it is singing or scratching up the earth and
leaves; and to watch its actions they must keep perfectly still.
The best way of procuring an example seems to be by hunting it
with dogs, when it will spring upon a branch to the height of 10 ft.
and afford an easy shot ere it has time to ascend farther or
escape as it does by leaps. Natives are said to hunt it by fixing
on their heads the erected tail of a cock-bird, which alone is
allowed to be seen above the brushwood. The greater part of
its time is said to be passed upon the ground, and seldom are
more than a pair to be found in company. One of the habits of
the cock is to form small round hillocks, which he constantly
visits during the day, mounting upon them and displaying his
tail by erecting it over his head, drooping his wings, scratching
and pecking at the soil, and uttering various cries&mdash;some his
own natural notes, others an imitation of those of other animals.
The tail, his most characteristic feature, only attains perfection
in the bird&rsquo;s third or fourth year, and then not until the month
of June, remaining until October, when the feathers are shed to be
renewed the following season. The food consists of insects,
especially beetles and myriapods, as well as snails. The nest is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span>
placed near to or on the ground, at the base of a rock or foot of
a tree, and is closely woven of fine but strong roots or other fibres,
and lined with feathers, around all which is heaped a mass, in
shape of an oven, of sticks, grass, moss and leaves, so as to project
over and shelter the interior structure, while an opening in the
side affords entrance and exit. Only one egg is laid, and this of
rather large size in proportion to the bird, of a purplish-grey
colour, suffused and blotched with dark purplish-brown.</p>

<p>Incubation is believed to begin in July or August, and the
young is hatched about a month later. It is at first covered with
dark down, and appears to remain for some weeks in the nest.
It is greatly to be hoped that so remarkable a form as the lyre-bird,
the nearly sole survivor apparently of a very ancient race
of beings, will not be allowed to become extinct&mdash;its almost
certain fate so far as can be judged&mdash;without many more observations
of its manners being made. Several examples of <i>Menura</i>
have been brought alive to Europe, and some have long survived
in captivity.</p>

<p>Three species of <i>Menura</i> have been indicated&mdash;the old <i>M.
superba</i>, the lyre-bird proper, which inhabits New South Wales,
the southern part of Queensland, and
perhaps some parts of Victoria; <i>M.
victoriae</i>, separated from the former by
Gould (<i>Proc. Zool. Soc.</i>, 1862, p. 23),
and said to take its place near Melbourne;
and <i>M. alberti</i>, first described
by C. L. Bonaparte (<i>Consp. Avium</i>, i.
215) on Gould&rsquo;s authority, and, though
discovered on the Richmond river in New
South Wales, having apparently a more
northern range than the other two. All
those have the apparent bulk of a hen
pheasant, but are really much smaller,
and their general plumage is of a sooty
brown, relieved by rufous on the chin,
throat, some of the wing-feathers and the
tail-coverts. The wings, consisting of
twenty-one remiges, are rather short and
rounded; the legs<a name="fa3m" id="fa3m" href="#ft3m"><span class="sp">3</span></a> and feet very strong,
with long, nearly straight claws. In
the immature and female the tail is
somewhat long, though affording no very remarkable character,
except the possession of sixteen rectrices; but in the
fully-plumaged male of <i>M. superba</i> and <i>M. victoriae</i> it is
developed in the extraordinary fashion that gives the bird its
common English name. The two exterior feathers (fig. 1, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>)
have the outer web very narrow, the inner very broad, and they
curve at first outwards, then somewhat inwards, and near the
tip outwards again, bending round forwards so as to present a
lyre-like form. But this is not all; their broad inner web,
which is of a lively chestnut colour, is apparently notched at
regular intervals by spaces that, according to the angle at which
they are viewed, seem either black or transparent; and this
effect is, on examination, found to be due to the barbs at those
spaces being destitute of barbules. The middle pair of feathers
(fig. 2, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) is nearly as abnormal. These have no outer web,
and the inner web very narrow; near their base they cross each
other, and then diverge, bending round forwards near their tip.
The remaining twelve feathers (fig. 3) except near the base are
very thinly furnished with barbs, about ¼ in. apart, and those
they possess, on their greater part, though long and flowing,
bear no barbules, and hence have a hair-like appearance. The
shafts of all are exceedingly strong. In the male of <i>M. alberti</i>
the tail is not only not lyriform, but the exterior rectrices are
shorter than the rest.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYRICAL POETRY,<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span> a general term for all poetry which is, or
can be supposed to be, susceptible of being sung to the accompaniment
of a musical instrument. In the earliest times it may
be said that all poetry was of its essence lyrical. The primeval
oracles were chanted in verse, and the Orphic and Bacchic
Mysteries, which were celebrated at Eleusis and elsewhere,
combined, it is certain, metre with music. Homer and Hesiod
are each of them represented with a lyre, yet if any poetry can
be described as non-lyrical, it is surely the archaic hexameter of
the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Erga</i>. These poems were styled epic, in direct
contradistinction to the lyric of Pindar and Bacchylides. But
inexactly, since it is plain that they were recited, with a plain
accompaniment on a stringed instrument. However, the distinction
between epical and lyrical, between <span class="grk" title="ta epê">&#964;&#8048; &#7956;&#960;&#951;</span>, what was said,
and <span class="grk" title="ta melê">&#964;&#8048; &#956;&#941;&#955;&#951;</span>, what was sung, is accepted, and neither Homer nor
Hesiod is among the lyrists. This distinction, however, is often
without a difference, as for example, in the case of the so-called
<i>Hymns</i> of Homer, epical in form but wholly lyrical in character.
Hegel, who has gone minutely into this question in his <i>Esthetik</i>,
contends that when poetry is objective it is epical, and when it is
subjective it is lyrical. This is to ignore the metrical form of the
poem, and to deal with its character only. It would constrain
us to regard Wordsworth&rsquo;s <i>Excursion</i> as a lyric, and Tennyson&rsquo;s
<i>Revenge</i> (where the subject is treated exactly as one of the
Homeridae would have treated an Ionian myth) as an epic.
This is impossible, and recalls us to the importance of taking the
form into consideration. But, with this warning, the definition
of Hegel is valuable. It is, as he insists, the personal thought, or
passion, or inspiration, which gives its character to lyrical poetry.</p>

<p>The lyric has the function of revealing, in terms of pure art,
the secrets of the inner life, its hopes, its fantastic joys, its
sorrows, its delirium. It is easier to exclude the dramatic species
from lyric than to banish the epic. There are large sections of
drama which it is inconceivable should be set to music, or sung,
or even given in recitative. The tragedies of Racine, for example,
are composed of the purest poetry, but they are essentially
non-lyrical, although lyrical portions are here and there
attached to them. The intensity of feeling and the melody of
verse in <i>Othello</i> does not make that work an example of lyrical
poetry, and this is even more acutely true of <i>Le Misanthrope</i>,
which is, nevertheless, a poem. The tendency of modern drama
is to divide itself further and further from lyric, but in early ages
the two kinds were indissoluble. Tragedy was goat-song, and the
earliest specimens of it were mainly composed of choruses. As
Prof. G. G. Murray says, in the <i>Suppliants</i> of Aeschylus, the
characters &ldquo;are singing for two-thirds of the play,&rdquo; accompanied
by tumultuous music. This primitive feature has gradually
been worn away; the chorus grew less and less prominent, and
disappeared; the very verse-ornament of drama tends to vanish,
and we have plays essentially so poetical as those of Ibsen and
Maeterlinck written from end to end in bare prose.</p>

<p>To return again to Greece, there was an early distinction, soon
accentuated, between the poetry chanted by a choir of singers,
and the song which expressed the sentiments of a single poet.
The latter, the <span class="grk" title="melos">&#956;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> or song proper, had reached a height of
technical perfection in &ldquo;the Isles of Greece, where burning
Sappho loved and sung,&rdquo; as early as the 7th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> That
poetess, and her contemporary Alcaeus, divide the laurels of the
pure Greek song of Dorian inspiration. By their side, and later,
flourished the great poets who set words to music for choirs,
Alcman, Arion, Stesichorus, Simonides and Ibycus, who lead us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span>
at the close of the 5th century to Bacchylides and Pindar, in
whom the magnificent tradition of the dithyrambic odes reached
its highest splendour of development. The practice of Pindar
and Sappho, we may say, has directed the course of lyrical poetry
ever since, and will, unquestionably, continue to do so. They
discovered how, with the maximum of art, to pour forth strains
of personal magic and music, whether in a public or a private
way. The ecstasy, the uplifted magnificence, of lyrical poetry
could go no higher than it did in the unmatched harmonies of
these old Greek poets, but it could fill a much wider field and be
expressed with vastly greater variety. It did so in their own
age. The gnomic verses of Theognis were certainly sung; so
were the satires of Archilochus and the romantic reveries of
Mimnermus.</p>

<p>At the Renaissance, when the traditions of ancient life were
taken up eagerly, and hastily comprehended, it was thought
proper to divide poetry into a diversity of classes. The earliest
English critic who enters into a discussion of the laws of prosody,
William Webbe, lays it down, in 1586, that in verse &ldquo;the most
usual kinds are four, the heroic, elegiac, iambic and lyric.&rdquo;
Similar confusion of terms was common among the critics of the
15th and 16th centuries, and led to considerable error. It is
plain that a border ballad is heroic, and may yet be lyrical; here
the word &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;epic.&rdquo; It is plain that whether
a poem is lyrical or not had nothing to do with the question
whether it is composed in an iambic measure. Finally, it is
undoubted that the early Greek &ldquo;elegies&rdquo; were sung to an
accompaniment on the flute, whether they were warlike, like
those of Tyrtaeus, or philosophical and amatory like those of
Theognis. But (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Elegy</a></span>) the present significance of &ldquo;elegy,&rdquo;
and this has been the case ever since late classical times, is
funereal; in modern parlance an elegy is a dirge. Whether the
great Alexandrian dirges, like those of Bion and of Moschus, on
which our elegiacal tradition is founded, were actually sung to an
accompaniment or not may be doubted; they seem too long, too
elaborate, and too ornate for that. But, at any rate, they were
composed on the convention that they would be sung, and it is
conceivable that music might have been wedded to the most
complex of these Alexandrian elegies. Accordingly, although
<i>Lycidas</i> and <i>Adonais</i> are not habitually &ldquo;set to music,&rdquo; there is
no reason why they should not be so set, and their rounded and
limited although extensive form links them with the song, not
with the epic. There are many odes of Swinburne&rsquo;s for which it
would be more difficult to write music than for his <i>Ave atque Vale</i>.
In fact, in spite of its solemn and lugubrious regularity, the
formal elegy or dirge is no more nor less than an ode, and is
therefore entirely lyrical.</p>

<p>More difficulty is met with in the case of the sonnet, for
although no piece of verse, when it is inspired by subjective
passion, fits more closely with Hegel&rsquo;s definition of what lyrical
poetry should be, yet the rhythmical complication of the sonnet,
and its rigorous uniformity, seem particularly ill-fitted to interpretation
on a lyre. When F. M. degli Azzi put the book of
Genesis (1700) into sonnets, and Isaac de Benserade the <i>Metamorphoses</i>
of Ovid (1676) into rondeaux, these eccentric and
laborious versifiers produced what was epical rather than lyrical
poetry, if poetry it was at all. But the sonnet as Shakespeare,
Wordsworth and even Petrarch used it was a cry from the heart,
a subjective confession, and although there is perhaps no evidence
that a sonnet was ever set to music with success, yet there
is no reason why that might not be done without destroying its
sonnet-character.</p>

<p>Jouffroy was perhaps the first aesthetician to see quite clearly
that lyrical poetry is, really, nothing more than another name
for poetry itself, that it includes all the personal and enthusiastic
part of what lives and breathes in the art of verse, so that the
divisions of pedantic criticism are of no real avail to us in its
consideration. We recognize a narrative or epical poetry; we
recognize drama; in both of these, when the individual inspiration
is strong, there is much that trembles on the verge of the
lyrical. But outside what is pure epic and pure drama, all, or
almost all, is lyrical. We say almost all, because the difficulty
arises of knowing where to place descriptive and didactic poetry.
The <i>Seasons</i> of Thomson, for instance, a poem of high merit and
lasting importance in the history of literature&mdash;where is that to
be placed? What is to be said of the <i>Essay on Man</i>? In
primitive times, the former would have been classed under epic,
the second would have been composed in the supple iambic
trimeter which so closely resembled daily speech, and would not
have been sharply distinguished from prose. Perhaps this
classification would still serve, were it not for the element of
versification, which makes a sharp line of demarcation between
poetic art and prose. This complexity of form, rhythmical and
stanzaic, takes much of the place which was taken in antiquity
by such music as Terpander is supposed to have supplied. In a
perfect lyric by a modern writer the instrument is the metrical
form, to which the words have to adapt themselves. There is
perhaps no writer who has ever lived in whose work this phenomenon
may be more fruitfully studied than it may be in the songs
and lyrics of Shelley. The temper of such pieces as &ldquo;Arethusa&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Cloud&rdquo; is indicated by a form hardly more ambitious
than a guitar; Hellas is full of passages which suggest the harp;
in his songs Shelley touches the lute or viol de gamba, while in
the great odes to the &ldquo;West Wind&rdquo; and to &ldquo;Liberty&rdquo; we listen
to a verse-form which reminds us by its volume of the organ
itself. On the whole subject of the nature of lyric poetry no
commentary can be more useful to the student than an examination
of the lyrics of Shelley in relation to those of the songwriters
of ancient Greece.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYSANDER<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="Lysandros">&#923;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>), son of Aristocritus, Spartan
admiral and diplomatist. Aelian (<i>Var. Hist.</i> xii. 43) and Phylarchus
(<i>ap.</i> Athen. vi. 271 e) say that he was a <i>mothax</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the son
of a helot mother (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Helots</a></span>), but this tradition is at least
doubtful; according to Plutarch he was a Heraclid, though not
of either royal family. We do not know how he rose to eminence:
he first appears as admiral of the Spartan navy in 407 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The
story of his influence with Cyrus the Younger, his naval victory off
Notium, his quarrel with his successor Callicratidas in 406, his
appointment as <span class="grk" title="epistoleus">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#949;&#973;&#962;</span> in 405, his decisive victory at Aegospotami,
and his share in the siege and capitulation of Athens
belong to the history of the Peloponnesian War (<i>q.v.</i>). By 404
he was the most powerful man in the Greek world and set about
completing the task of building up a Spartan empire in which
he should be supreme in fact if not in name. Everywhere
democracies were replaced by oligarchies directed by bodies
of ten men (decarchies, <span class="grk" title="dekarchiai">&#948;&#949;&#954;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#943;&#945;&#953;</span>) under the control of Spartan
governors (harmosts, <span class="grk" title="harmostai">&#7937;&#961;&#956;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#943;</span>). But Lysander&rsquo;s boundless influence
and ambition, and the superhuman honours paid him,
roused the jealousy of the kings and the ephors, and, on being
accused by the Persian satrap Pharnabazus, he was recalled to
Sparta. Soon afterwards he was sent to Athens with an army
to aid the oligarchs, but Pausanias, one of the kings, followed
him and brought about a restoration of democracy. On the death
of Agis II., Lysander secured the succession of Agesilaus (<i>q.v.</i>),
whom he hoped to find amenable to his influence. But in this
he was disappointed. Though chosen to accompany the king to
Asia as one of his thirty advisers (<span class="grk" title="symbouloi">&#963;&#973;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span>), he was kept inactive
and his influence was broken by studied affronts, and
finally he was sent at his own request as envoy to the Hellespont.
He soon returned to Sparta to mature plans for overthrowing
the hereditary kingship and substituting an elective monarchy
open to all Heraclids, or even, according to another version, to
all Spartiates. But his alleged attempts to bribe the oracles were
fruitless, and his schemes were cut short by the outbreak of war
with Thebes in 395. Lysander invaded Boeotia from the west,
receiving the submission of Orchomenus and sacking Lebadea,
but the enemy intercepted his despatch to Pausanias, who had
meanwhile entered Boeotia from the south, containing plans for
a joint attack upon Haliartus. The town was at once strongly
garrisoned, and when Lysander marched against it he was defeated
and slain. He was buried in the territory of Panopeus, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>
nearest Phocian city. An able commander and an adroit
diplomatist, Lysander was fired by the ambition to make
Sparta supreme in Greece and himself in Sparta. To this end
he shrank from no treachery or cruelty; yet, like Agesilaus,
he was totally free from the characteristic Spartan vice of
avarice, and died, as he had lived, a poor man.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYSANIAS,<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> tetrarch of Abilene (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Abila</a></span>), according to
Luke iii. 1, in the time of John the Baptist. The only Lysanias
mentioned in profane history as exercising authority in this
district was executed in 36 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by M. Antonius (Mark Antony).
This Lysanias was the son of Ptolemy Mennaeus, the ruler of an
independent state, of which Abilene formed only a small portion.
According to Josephus (<i>Ant.</i> xix. 5, 1) the emperor Claudius
in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 42 confirmed Agrippa I. in the possession of &ldquo;Abila of
Lysanias&rdquo; already bestowed upon him by Caligula, elsewhere
described as &ldquo;Abila, which had formed the tetrarchy of
Lysanias.&rdquo; It is argued that this cannot refer to the Lysanias
executed by M. Antonius, since his paternal inheritance, even
allowing for some curtailment by Pompey, must have been of
far greater extent. It is therefore assumed by some authorities
that the Lysanias in Luke (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 28-29) is a younger Lysanias,
tetrarch of Abilene only, one of the districts into which the
original kingdom was split up after the death of Lysanias I.
This younger Lysanias may have been a son of the latter, and
identical with, or the father of, the Claudian Lysanias. On the
other hand, Josephus knows nothing of a younger Lysanias,
and it is suggested by others that he really does refer to Lysanias I.
The explanation given by M. Krenkel (<i>Josephus und Lucas</i>,
Leipzig, 1894, p. 97) is that Josephus does not mean to imply
that Abila was the only possession of Lysanias, and that he calls
it the tetrarchy or kingdom of Lysanias because it was the last
remnant of the domain of Lysanias which remained under direct
Roman administration until the time of Agrippa. The expression
was borrowed from Josephus by Luke, who wrongly imagined
that Lysanias I. had ruled almost up to the time of the bestowal
of his tetrarchy upon Agrippa, and therefore to the days of John
the Baptist. Two inscriptions are adduced as evidence for
the existence of a younger Lysanias&mdash;Böckh, <i>C.I.G.</i> 4521 and
4523. The former is inconclusive, and in the latter the reading
<span class="grk" title="Ans[aniou]">&#913;&#957;&#963;[&#945;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#965;]</span> is entirely conjectural; the name might equally well
be Lysimachus or Lysias.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYSIAS,<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span> Attic orator, was born, according to Dionysius of
Halicarnassus and the author of the life ascribed to Plutarch,
in 459 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> This date was evidently obtained by reckoning back
from the foundation of Thurii (444 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), since there was a tradition
that Lysias had gone thither at the age of fifteen. Modern
critics would place his birth later,&mdash;between 444 and 436 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,&mdash;because,
in Plato&rsquo;s <i>Republic</i>, of which the scene is laid about
430 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, Cephalus, the father of Lysias, is among the <i>dramatis
personae</i>, and the emigration of Lysias to Thurii was said to
have followed his father&rsquo;s death. The latter statement, however,
rests only on the Plutarchic life; nor can Plato&rsquo;s dialogue be
safely urged as a minutely accurate authority. The higher date
assigned by the ancient writers agrees better with the tradition
that Lysias reached, or passed, the age of eighty.<a name="fa1n" id="fa1n" href="#ft1n"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Cephalus,
his father, was a native of Syracuse, and on the invitation of
Pericles had settled at Athens. The opening scene of Plato&rsquo;s
<i>Republic</i> is laid at the house of his eldest son, Polemarchus, in
Peiraeus. The tone of the picture warrants the inference that
the Sicilian family were well known to Plato, and that their
houses must often have been hospitable to such gatherings.</p>

<p>At Thurii, the colony newly planted on the Tarentine Gulf
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pericles</a></span>), the boy may have seen Herodotus, now a man in
middle life, and a friendship may have grown up between
them. There, too, Lysias is said to have commenced his studies
in rhetoric&mdash;doubtless under a master of the Sicilian school&mdash;possibly,
as tradition said, under Tisias, the pupil of Corax, whose
name is associated with the first attempt to formulate rhetoric as
an art. In 413 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the Athenian armament in Sicily was annihilated.
The desire to link famous names is illustrated by the
ancient ascription to Lysias of a rhetorical exercise purporting
to be a speech in which the captive general Nicias appealed
for mercy to the Sicilians. The terrible blow to Athens quickened
the energies of an anti-Athenian faction at Thurii. Lysias and
his elder brother Polemarchus, with three hundred other persons,
were &ldquo;accused of Atticizing.&rdquo; They were driven from Thurii
and settled at Athens (412 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>).</p>

<p>Lysias and Polemarchus were rich men, having inherited
property from their father; and Lysias claims that, though
merely resident aliens, they discharged public services with
a liberality which shamed many of those who enjoyed the
franchise (<i>In Eratosth.</i> 20). The fact that they owned house
property shows that they were classed as <span class="grk" title="isoteleis">&#7984;&#963;&#959;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span>, <i>i.e.</i> foreigners
who paid only the same tax as citizens, being exempt from the
special tax (<span class="grk" title="metoikion">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#943;&#954;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>) on resident aliens. Polemarchus occupied
a house in Athens itself, Lysias another in the Peiraeus, near
which was their shield manufactory, employing a hundred
and twenty skilled slaves. In 404 the Thirty Tyrants were
established at Athens under the protection of a Spartan garrison.
One of their earliest measures was an attack upon the resident
aliens, who were represented as disaffected to the new government.
Lysias and Polemarchus were on a list of ten singled
out to be the first victims. Polemarchus was arrested, and
compelled to drink hemlock. Lysias had a narrow escape,
with the help of a large bribe. He slipped by a back-door out of
the house in which he was a prisoner, and took boat to Megara.
It appears that he had rendered valuable services to the exiles
during the reign of the tyrants, and in 403 Thrasybulus proposed
that these services should be recognized by the bestowal of the
citizenship. The Boul&#275;, however, had not yet been reconstituted,
and hence the measure could not be introduced to the ecclesia
by the requisite &ldquo;preliminary resolution&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="probouleuma">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#946;&#959;&#973;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;</span>).
On this ground it was successfully opposed.</p>

<p>During his later years Lysias&mdash;now probably a comparatively
poor man owing to the rapacity of the tyrants and his own
generosity to the Athenian exiles&mdash;appears as a hardworking
member of a new profession&mdash;that of writing speeches to be
delivered in the law-courts. The thirty-four extant are but a
small fraction. From 403 to about 380 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> his industry must
have been incessant. The notices of his personal life in these
years are scanty. In 403 he came forward as the accuser of
Eratosthenes, one of the Thirty Tyrants. This was his only
direct contact with Athenian politics. The story that he wrote
a defence for Socrates, which the latter declined to use, probably
arose from a confusion. Several years after the death of Socrates
the sophist Polycrates composed a declamation against him,
to which Lysias replied. A more authentic tradition represents
Lysias as having spoken his own <i>Olympiacus</i> at the Olympic
festival of 388 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, to which Dionysius I. of Syracuse had sent
a magnificent embassy. Tents embroidered with gold were
pitched within the sacred enclosure; and the wealth of Dionysius
was vividly shown by the number of chariots which he had
entered. Lysias lifted up his voice to denounce Dionysius as,
next to Artaxerxes, the worst enemy of Hellas, and to impress
upon the assembled Greeks that one of their foremost duties
was to deliver Sicily from a hateful oppression. The latest
work of Lysias which we can date (a fragment of a speech
<i>For Pherenicus</i>) belongs to 381 or 380 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> He probably died
in or soon after 380 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Lysias was a man of kindly and genial nature, warm in
friendship, loyal to country, with a keen perception of character.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span>
and a fine though strictly controlled sense of humour. The
literary tact which is so remarkable in the extant speeches
is that of a singularly flexible intelligence, always obedient
to an instinct of gracefulness. He owes his distinctive place to
the power of concealing his art. It was obviously desirable
that a speech written for delivery by a client should be suitable
to his age, station and circumstances. Lysias was the first to
make this adaptation really artistic. His skill can be best
appreciated if we turn from the easy flow of his graceful language
to the majestic emphasis of Antiphon, or to the self-revealing
art of Isaeus. Translated into terms of ancient criticism, he
became the model of the &ldquo;plain style&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="iochnos charaktêr, iochnê,
litê, aphelês lexis">&#7984;&#959;&#967;&#957;&#8056;&#962; &#967;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#942;&#961;, &#7984;&#959;&#967;&#957;&#8052;, &#955;&#953;&#964;&#8052;, &#7936;&#966;&#949;&#955;&#8052;&#962; &#955;&#941;&#958;&#953;&#962;</span>: <i>genus tenue</i> or <i>subtile</i>). Greek and then
Roman critics distinguished three styles of rhetorical composition&mdash;the
&ldquo;grand&rdquo; (or &ldquo;elaborate&rdquo;), the &ldquo;plain&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;middle,&rdquo; the &ldquo;plain&rdquo; being nearest to the language of daily life.
Greek rhetoric began in the &ldquo;grand&rdquo; style; then Lysias set an
exquisite pattern of the &ldquo;plain&rdquo;; and Demosthenes might be
considered as having effected an almost ideal compromise.</p>

<p>The vocabulary of Lysias is pure and simple. Most of the
rhetorical &ldquo;figures&rdquo; are sparingly used&mdash;except such as consist
in the parallelism or opposition of clauses. The taste of the day&mdash;not
yet emancipated from the influence of the Sicilian rhetoric&mdash;probably
demanded a large use of antithesis. Lysias excels
in vivid description; he has also a happy knack of marking
the speaker&rsquo;s character by light touches. The structure of his
sentences varies a good deal according to the dignity of the
subject. He has equal command over the &ldquo;periodic&rdquo; style
(<span class="grk" title="katestrammenê lexis">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951; &#955;&#941;&#958;&#953;&#962;</span>) and the non-periodic or &ldquo;continuous&rdquo;
(<span class="grk" title="eiromenê, dialelumenê">&#949;&#7984;&#961;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;, &#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;</span>). His disposition of his subject-matter
is always simple. The speech has usually four parts&mdash;introduction
(<span class="grk" title="prooimion">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#959;&#943;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>), narrative of facts (<span class="grk" title="diêgêsis">&#948;&#953;&#942;&#947;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>), proofs (<span class="grk" title="pisteis">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>),
which may be either external, as from witnesses, or internal,
derived from argument on the facts, and, lastly, conclusion
(<span class="grk" title="epilogos">&#7952;&#960;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>). It is in the introduction and the narrative that
Lysias is seen at his best. In his greatest extant speech&mdash;that
<i>Against Eratosthenes</i>&mdash;and also in the fragmentary <i>Olympiacus</i>,
he has pathos and fire; but these were not characteristic
qualities of his work. In Cicero&rsquo;s judgment (<i>De Orat.</i> iii. 7, 28)
Demosthenes was peculiarly distinguished by force (<i>vis</i>), Aeschines
by resonance (<i>sonitus</i>), Hypereides by acuteness (<i>acumen</i>),
Isocrates by sweetness (<i>suavitas</i>); the distinction which he
assigns to Lysias is <i>subtilitas</i>, an Attic refinement&mdash;which, as
he elsewhere says (<i>Brutus</i>, 16, 64) is often joined to an admirable
vigour (<i>lacerti</i>). Nor was it oratory alone to which Lysias
rendered service; his work had an important effect on all subsequent
Greek prose, by showing how perfect elegance could be
joined to plainness. Here, in his artistic use of familiar idiom,
he might fairly be called the Euripides of Attic prose. And his
style has an additional charm for modern readers, because it is
employed in describing scenes from the everyday life of Athens.<a name="fa2n" id="fa2n" href="#ft2n"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Thirty-four speeches (three fragmentary) have come down under
the name of Lysias; one hundred and twenty-seven more, now lost,

own work; but the certainty of this conclusion will be doubted by
those who observe (1) the elaborate preparations made in the
dialogue for a recital of the <span class="grk" title="erôtikos">&#7952;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span> which shall be <i>verbally exact</i>,
and (2) the closeness of the criticism made upon it. If the satirist
were merely analysing his own composition, such criticism would
have little point. Lysias is the earliest writer who is known to have
composed <span class="grk" title="erôtikoi">&#7952;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#943;</span>; it is as representing both rhetoric and a false
<span class="grk" title="erôs">&#7956;&#961;&#969;&#962;</span> that he is the object of attack in the <i>Phaedrus</i>.</p>

<p>F. <span class="sc">Fragments.</span>&mdash;Three hundred and fifty-five of these are collected
by Sauppe, <i>Oratores Attici</i>, ii. 170-216. Two hundred and fifty-two of
them represent one hundred and twenty-seven speeches of known
title; and of six the fragments are comparatively large. Of these,
the fragmentary speech <i>For Pherenicus</i> belongs to 381 or 380 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
and is thus the latest known work of Lysias.<a name="fa3n" id="fa3n" href="#ft3n"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>In literary and historical interest, the first place among the extant
speeches of Lysias belongs to that <i>Against Eratosthenes</i> (403 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>),
one of the Thirty Tyrants, whom Lysias arraigns as the murderer of
his brother Polemarchus. The speech is an eloquent and vivid
picture of the reign of terror which the Thirty established at Athens;
the concluding appeal, to both parties among the citizens, is specially
powerful. Next in importance is the speech <i>Against Agoratus</i>
(399 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), one of our chief authorities for the internal history of
Athens during the months which immediately followed the defeat
at Aegospotami. The <i>Olympiacus</i> (388 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) is a brilliant fragment,
expressing the spirit of the festival at Olympia, and exhorting Greeks
to unite against their common foes. The <i>Plea for the Constitution</i>
(403 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) is interesting for the manner in which it argues that the
wellbeing of Athens&mdash;now stripped of empire&mdash;is bound up with the
maintenance of democratic principles. The speech <i>For Mantitheus</i>
(392 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) is a graceful and animated portrait of a young Athenian
<span class="grk" title="hippeus">&#7985;&#960;&#960;&#949;&#973;&#962;</span>, making a spirited defence of his honour against the charge of
disloyalty. The defence <i>For the Invalid</i> is a humorous character-sketch.
The speech <i>Against Pancleon</i> illustrates the intimate relations
between Athens and Plataea, while it gives us some picturesque
glimpses of Athenian town life. The defence of the person who had
been charged with destroying a <i>moria</i>, or sacred olive, places us amidst
the country life of Attica. And the speech <i>Against Theomnestus</i>
deserves attention for its curious evidence of the way in which the
ordinary vocabulary of Athens had changed between 600 and 400 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p>All MSS. of Lysias yet collated have been derived, as H. Sauppe
first showed, from the Codex Palatinus X. (Heidelberg). The next
most valuable MS. is the Laurentianus C (15th century), which
I. Bekker chiefly followed. Speaking generally, we may say that
these two MSS. are the only two which carry much weight where the
text is seriously corrupt. In <i>Oratt.</i> i.-ix. Bekker occasionally consulted
eleven other MSS., most of which contain only the above nine
speeches: viz., Marciani F, G, I, K (Venice); Laurentiani D, E
(Florence); Vaticani M, N; Parisini U, V; Urbinas O.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYSIMACHUS<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 355-281 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Macedonian general, son
of Agathocles, was a citizen of Pella in Macedonia. During
Alexander&rsquo;s Persian campaigns he was one of his immediate
bodyguard and distinguished himself in India. After Alexander&rsquo;s
death he was appointed to the government of Thrace and the
Chersonese. For a long time he was chiefly occupied with
fighting against the Odrysian king Seuthes. In 315 he joined
Cassander, Ptolemy and Seleucus against Antigonus, who,
however, diverted his attention by stirring up Thracian and
Scythian tribes against him. In 309, he founded Lysimachia
in a commanding situation on the neck connecting the Chersonese
with the mainland. He followed the example of Antigonus
in taking the title of king. In 302 when the second alliance
between Cassander, Ptolemy and Seleucus was made, Lysimachus,
reinforced by troops from Cassander, entered Asia
Minor, where he met with little resistance. On the approach
of Antigonus he retired into winter quarters near Heraclea,
marrying its widowed queen Amastris, a Persian princess.
Seleucus joined him in 301, and at the battle of Ipsus Antigonus
was slain. His dominions were divided among the victors,
Lysimachus receiving the greater part of Asia Minor. Feeling
that Seleucus was becoming dangerously great, he now allied
himself with Ptolemy, marrying his daughter Arsinoë. Amastris,
who had divorced herself from him, returned to Heraclea. When
Antigonus&rsquo;s son Demetrius renewed hostilities (297), during his
absence in Greece, Lysimachus seized his towns in Asia Minor,
but in 294 concluded a peace whereby Demetrius was recognized
as ruler of Macedonia. He tried to carry his power beyond
the Danube, but was defeated and taken prisoner by the Getae,
who, however, set him free on amicable terms. Demetrius
subsequently threatened Thrace, but had to retire in consequence
of a rising in Boeotia, and an attack from Pyrrhus of Epirus.
In 288 Lysimachus and Pyrrhus in turn invaded Macedonia,
and drove Demetrius out of the country. Pyrrhus was at first
allowed to remain in possession of Macedonia with the title
of king, but in 285 he was expelled by Lysimachus. Domestic
troubles embittered the last years of Lysimachus&rsquo;s life. Amastris
had been murdered by her two sons; Lysimachus treacherously
put them to death. On his return Arsinoë asked the gift
of Heraclea, and he granted her request, though he had promised
to free the city. In 284 Arsinoë, desirous of gaining the succession
for her sons in preference to Agathocles (the eldest son
of Lysimachus), intrigued against him with the help of her
brother Ptolemy Ceraunus; they accused him of conspiring
with Seleucus to seize the throne, and he was put to death. This
atrocious deed of Lysimachus aroused great indignation. Many
of the cities of Asia revolted, and his most trusted friends
deserted him. The widow of Agathocles fled to Seleucus, who
at once invaded the territory of Lysimachus in Asia. Lysimachus
crossed the Hellespont, and in 281 a decisive battle
took place at the plain of Corus (Corupedion) in Lydia. Lysimachus
was killed; after some days his body, watched by a
faithful dog, was found on the field, and given up to his son
Alexander, by whom it was interred at Lysimachia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYSIPPUS,<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> Greek sculptor, was head of the school of Argos
and Sicyon in the time of Philip and Alexander of Macedon.
His works are said to have numbered 1500, some of them colossal.
Some accounts make him the continuer of the school of Polyclitus;
some represent him as self-taught. The matter in
which he especially innovated was the proportions of the male
human body; he made the head smaller than his predecessors,
the body more slender and hard, so as to give the impression of
greater height. He also took great pains with hair and other
details. Pliny (<i>N.H.</i> 34, 61) and other writers mention many
of his statues. Among the gods he seems to have produced new
and striking types of Zeus (probably of the Otricoli class), of
Poseidon (compare the Poseidon of the Lateran, standing with
raised foot), of the Sun-god and others; many of these were
colossal figures in bronze. Among heroes he was specially
attracted by the mighty physique of Hercules. The Hercules
Farnese of Naples, though signed by Glycon of Athens, and a
later and exaggerated transcript, owes something, including
the motive of rest after labour, to Lysippus. Lysippus made
many statues of Alexander the Great, and so satisfied his patron,
no doubt by idealizing him, that he became the court sculptor
of the king, from whom and from whose generals he received
many commissions. The extant portraits of Alexander vary
greatly, and it is impossible to determine which among them go
back to Lysippus. The remarkable head from Alexandria
(Plate II. fig. 56, in <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Art</a></span>) has as good a claim as any.</p>

<p>As head of the great athletic school of Peloponnese Lysippus
naturally sculptured many athletes; a figure by him of a man
scraping himself with a strigil was a great favourite of the
Romans in the time of Tiberius (Pliny, <i>N.H.</i> 34, 61); and
this has been usually regarded as the original copied in the
Apoxyomenus of the Vatican (<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Art</a></span>, Plate VI. fig. 79).
If so, the copyist has modernized his copy, for some features
of the Apoxyomenus belong to the Hellenistic age. With more
certainty we may see a copy of an athlete by Lysippus in the
statue of Agias found at Delphi (<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Art</a></span>, Plate V. fig. 74),
which is proved by inscriptions to be a replica in marble of a
bronze statue set up by Lysippus in Thessaly. And when the
Agias and the Apoxyomenus are set side by side their differences

His life is obscure, but it is generally accepted, that in the

he escaped and went to Thebes, where he came under the

he has been credited with many of the works usually attributed
to Pythagoras himself. Diogenes Laertius viii. 6 gives him
three, and Mullach even assigns to him the <i>Golden Verses</i>. But
it is generally held that these verses are a collection of lines by

and was educated at Enniskillen school and at Trinity College,
Dublin. He took orders in 1815, and for some time held a
curacy near Wexford. Owing to infirm health he came to
England, and after several changes settled, in 1823, in the

<p><span class="bold">LYTTELTON, GEORGE LYTTELTON,<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Baron</span> (1709-1773),
English statesman and man of letters, born at Hagley,
Worcestershire, was a descendant of the great jurist Sir Thomas
Littleton (<i>q.v.</i>). He was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton,
4th bart. (d. 1751), who at the revolution of 1688 and during
the following reign was one of the ablest Whig debaters of the
House of Commons.<a name="fa1o" id="fa1o" href="#ft1o"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Lyttelton was educated at Eton and
Oxford, and in 1728 set out on the grand tour, spending considerable
periods at Paris and Rome. On his return to England
he sat in parliament for Okehampton, Devonshire, beginning
public life in the same year with Pitt. From 1744 to 1754 he
held the office of a lord commissioner of the treasury. In 1755
he succeeded Legge as chancellor of the exchequer, but in 1756
he quitted office, being raised to the peerage as Baron Lyttelton,
of Frankley, in the county of Worcester. In the political crisis
of 1765, before the formation of the Rockingham administration,
it was suggested that he might be placed at the head of the
treasury, but he declined to take part in any such scheme. The
closing years of his life were devoted chiefly to literary pursuits.
He died on the 22nd of August 1773.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lyttelton&rsquo;s earliest publication (1735), <i>Letters from a Persian in
England to his Friend at Ispahan</i>, appeared anonymously. Much
greater celebrity was achieved by his <i>Observations on the Conversion
and Apostleship of St Paul</i>, also anonymous, published in 1747. It
takes the form of a letter to Gilbert West, and is designed to show
that St Paul&rsquo;s conversion is of itself a sufficient demonstration of the
divine character of Christianity. Dr Johnson regarded the work as
one &ldquo;to which infidelity has never been able to fabricate a specious
answer.&rdquo; Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s <i>Dialogues of the Dead</i>, a creditable performance,
though hardly rivalling either Lucian or Landor, appeared
in 1760. His <i>History of Henry II.</i> (1767-1771), the fruit of twenty
years&rsquo; labour, is not now cited as an authority, but is painstaking and
fair. Lyttelton was also a writer of verse; his <i>Monody</i> on his wife&rsquo;s
death has been praised by Gray for its elegiac tenderness, and his
<i>Prologue</i> to the <i>Coriolanus</i> of his friend Thomson shows genuine
feeling. He was also the author of the well-known stanza in the
<i>Castle of Indolence</i>, in which the poet himself is described. A complete
collection of the <i>Works</i> of Lord Lyttelton was published by his
nephew, G. E. Ayscough in 1774.</p>
</div>

<p>His son <span class="sc">Thomas</span> (1744-1779), who succeeded as 2nd baron,
played some part in the political life of his time, but his loose
and prodigal habits were notorious, and he is known, in distinction
to his father &ldquo;the good lord,&rdquo; as the wicked Lord
Lyttelton. He left no lawful issue, and the barony became
extinct; but it was revived in 1794 in the person of his uncle
<span class="sc">William Henry</span>, 1st baron of the new creation (1724-1808),
who was governor of S. Carolina and later of Jamaica, and
ambassador to Portugal. The new barony went after him to his
two sons. The 3rd baron (1782-1837) was succeeded by his son
<span class="sc">George William Lyttelton</span>, 4th baron (1817-1876), who was
a fine scholar, and brother-in-law of W. E. Gladstone, having
married Miss Mary Glynne. He did important work in educational
and poor law reform. He had eight sons, of whom the
eldest, <span class="sc">Charles George</span> (b. 1842), became 5th baron, and in
1889 succeeded, by the death of the 3rd duke of Buckingham
and Chandos, to the viscounty of Cobham, in which title the
barony of Lyttelton is now merged. Other distinguished sons
were Arthur Temple Lyttelton (d. 1903), warden of Selwyn
College, Cambridge, and bishop-suffragan of Southampton;
Edward Lyttelton (b. 1855), headmaster of Haileybury (1890-1905)
and then of Eton; and Alfred Lyttelton (b. 1857), secretary
of state for the colonies (1903-1906). It was a family of
well-known cricketers, Alfred being in his day the best wicket-keeper
in England as well as a fine tennis player.</p>

<p><a name="ft1o" id="ft1o" href="#fa1o"><span class="fn">1</span></a> Sir Thomas (or Thomas de) Littleton, the jurist, had three sons,
William, Richard and Thomas. From the first, William, was
descended Sir Thomas Lyttelton, 1st bart. of Frankley (1596-1650),
whose sons were Sir Henry, 2nd bart. (d. 1693), and Sir Charles,
3rd bart. (1629-1716), governor of Jamaica. The latter&rsquo;s son was
Sir Thomas, 4th bart., above mentioned, who was also the father of
Charles Lyttelton (1714-1768), bishop of Carlisle, and president of the
Society of Antiquaries. The male descendants of the second,
Richard, died out with Sir Edward Littleton, bart., of Pillaton,
Staffordshire, in 1812, but the latter&rsquo;s grandnephew, Edward John
Walhouse (1791-1863) of Hatherton, took the estates by will and
also the name of Littleton, and was created 1st Baron Hatherton in
1835; he was chief secretary for Ireland (1833-1834). From
Thomas, the third son, was descended, in one line, Edward, Lord
Littleton, of Munslow (1589-1645), recorder of London, chief justice
of the common pleas, and eventually lord keeper; and in another
line, the baronets of Stoke St Milborough, Shropshire, of whom the
best known and last was Sir Thomas Littleton, 3rd bart. (1647-1710),
speaker of the House of Commons (1698-1700), and treasurer

<p><span class="bold">LYTTON, EDWARD GEORGE EARLE LYTTON, BULWER-LYTTON,<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span>
<span class="sc">1st Baron</span> (1803-1873), English novelist and politician,
the youngest son of General William Earle Bulwer of Heydon
Hall and Wood Dalling, Norfolk, was born in London on the
25th of May 1803. He had two brothers, William (1790-1877)
and Henry (1801-1872), afterwards Lord Dalling (<i>q.v.</i>). Bulwer&rsquo;s
father died when the boy was four years old. His mother,
Elizabeth Barbara, daughter of Richard Warburton Lytton of
Knebworth, Hertfordshire, after her husband&rsquo;s death settled in
London. Bulwer, who was delicate and neurotic, gave evidence
of precocious talent and was sent to various boarding schools,
where he was always discontented, until in the establishment of
a Mr Wallington at Ealing he found in his master a sympathetic
and admiring listener. Mr Wallington induced him to publish,
at the age of fifteen, an immature volume entitled <i>Ishmael and
other Poems</i>. About this time Bulwer fell in love, and became
extremely morbid under enforced separation from the young lady,
who was induced by her father to marry another man. She died
about the time that Bulwer went to Cambridge, and he declared
that her loss affected all his after-life. In 1822 he entered
Trinity College, Cambridge, but removed shortly afterwards to
Trinity Hall, and in 1825 won the Chancellor&rsquo;s medal for English
verse with a poem on &ldquo;Sculpture.&rdquo; In the following year he
took his B.A. degree and printed for private circulation a small
volume of poems, <i>Weeds and Wild Flowers</i>, in which the influence
of Byron was easily traceable. In 1827 he published <i>O&rsquo;Neill, or
the Rebel</i>, a romance, in heroic couplets, of patriotic struggle
in Ireland, and in 1831 a metrical satire, <i>The Siamese Twins</i>.
These juvenilia he afterwards ignored.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had begun to take his place in society, being
already known as a dandy of considerable pretensions, who had
acted as second in a duel and experienced the fashionable
round of flirtation and intrigue. He purchased a commission in
the army, only to sell it again without undergoing any service,
and in August 1827 married, in opposition to his mother&rsquo;s wishes,
Rosina Doyle Wheeler (1802-1882), an Irish beauty, niece and
adopted daughter of General Sir John Doyle. She was a brilliant
but passionate girl, and upon his marriage with her, Bulwer&rsquo;s
mother withdrew the allowance she had hitherto made him.
He had £200 a year from his father, and less than £100 a year
with his wife, and found it necessary to set to work in earnest.
In the year of his marriage he published <i>Falkland</i>, a novel
which was only a moderate success, but in 1828 he attracted
general attention with <i>Pelham</i>, a novel for which he had gathered
material during a visit to Paris in 1825. This story, with its
intimate study of the dandyism of the age, was immediately
popular, and gossip was busy in identifying the characters of the
romance with the leading men of the time. In the same year he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>186</span>
published <i>The Disowned</i>, following it up with <i>Devereux</i> (1829),
<i>Paul Clifford</i> (1830), <i>Eugene Aram</i> (1832) and <i>Godolphin</i> (1833).
All these novels were designed with a didactic purpose, somewhat
upon the German model. To embody the leading features
of a period, to show how a criminal may be reformed by the
development of his own character, to explain the secrets of failure
and success in life, these were the avowed objects of his art,
and there were not wanting critics ready to call in question his
sincerity and his morality. Magazine controversy followed, in
which Bulwer was induced to take a part, and about the same
time he began to make a mark in politics. He became a follower
of Bentham, and in 1831 was elected member for St Ives in
Huntingdon. During this period of feverish activity his relations
with his wife grew less and less satisfactory. At first she had
cause to complain that he neglected her in the pursuit of literary
reputation; later on his disregard became rather active than
passive. After a series of distressing differences they decided
to live apart, and were legally separated in 1836. Three years
later his wife published a novel called <i>Cheveley, or the Man of
Honour</i>, in which Bulwer was bitterly caricatured, and in June
1858, when her husband was standing as parliamentary candidate
for Hertfordshire, she appeared at the hustings and indignantly
denounced him. She was consequently placed under restraint as
insane, but liberated a few weeks later. For years she continued
her attacks upon her husband&rsquo;s character, and outlived him by
nine years, dying at Upper Sydenham in March 1882. There is
little doubt that her passionate imagination gravely exaggerated
the tale of her wrongs, though Bulwer was certainly no model
for husbands. It was a case of two undisciplined natures in
domestic bondage, and the consequences of their union were as
inevitable as they were unfortunate.</p>

<p>Bulwer, meanwhile, was full of activity, both literary and
political. After representing St Ives, he was returned for Lincoln
in 1832, and sat in parliament for that city for nine years. He
spoke in favour of the Reform Bill, and took the leading part in
securing the reduction, after vainly essaying the repeal, of the
newspaper stamp duties. His pamphlet, issued when the Whigs
were dismissed from office in 1834, and entitled &ldquo;A Letter to a
Late Cabinet Minister on the Crisis,&rdquo; was immensely influential,
and Lord Melbourne offered him a lordship of the admiralty,
which he declined as likely to interfere with his activity as an
author. At this time, indeed, his pen was indefatigable. <i>Godolphin</i>
was followed by <i>The Pilgrims of the Rhine</i> (1834), a graceful
fantasy, too German in sentiment to be quite successful in England,
and then in <i>The Last Days of Pompeii</i> (1834) and Rienzi
(1835) he reached the height of his popularity. He took great
pains with these stories, and despite their lurid colouring and
mannered over-emphasis, they undoubtedly indicate the highwater
mark of his talent. Their reception was enthusiastic, and
<i>Ernest Maltravers</i> (1837) and <i>Alice, or the Mysteries</i> (1838) were
hardly less successful. At the same time he had been plunging
into journalism. In 1831 he undertook the editorship of the
<i>New Monthly</i>, which, however, he resigned in the following year,
but in 1841, the year in which he published <i>Night and Morning</i>,
he started the <i>Monthly Chronicle</i>, a semi-scientific magazine, for
which he wrote <i>Zicci</i>, an unfinished first draft afterwards expanded
into <i>Zanoni</i> (1842). As though this multifarious fecundity
were not sufficient, he had also been busy in the field of dramatic
literature. In 1838 he produced <i>The Lady of Lyons</i>, a play which
Macready made a great success at Covent Garden: in 1839
<i>Richelieu</i> and <i>The Sea Captain</i>, and in 1840 <i>Money</i>. All, except
<i>The Sea Captain</i>, were successful, and this solitary failure he
revived in 1869 under the title of <i>The Rightful Heir</i>. Of the
others it may be said that, though they abound in examples of
strained sentiment and false taste, they have nevertheless a
certain theatrical <i>flair</i>, which has enabled them to survive a
whole library of stage literature of greater sincerity and truer
feeling. <i>The Lady of Lyons</i> and <i>Money</i> have long held the stage,
and to the last-named, at least, some of the most talented of
modern comedians have given new life and probability.</p>

<p>In 1838 Bulwer, then at the height of his popularity, was
created a baronet, and on succeeding to the Knebworth estate
in 1843 added Lytton to his surname, under the terms of his
mother&rsquo;s will. From 1841 to 1852 he had no seat in parliament,
and spent much of his time in continental travel. His literary
activity waned somewhat, but was still remarkably alert for a
man who had already done so much. In 1843 he issued <i>The
Last of the Barons</i>, which many critics have considered the most
historically sound and generally effective of all his romances;
in 1847 <i>Lucretia, or the Children of the Night</i>, and in 1848 <i>Harold,
the last of the Saxon Kings</i>. In the intervals between these
heavier productions he had thrown off a volume of poems in
1842, another of translations from Schiller in 1844, and a satire
called <i>The New Timon</i> in 1846, in which Tennyson, who had just
received a Civil List pension, was bitterly lampooned as &ldquo;school
miss Alfred,&rdquo; with other unedifying amenities; Tennyson
retorted with some verses in which he addressed Bulwer-Lytton
as &ldquo;you band-box.&rdquo; These poetic excursions were followed by
his most ambitious work in metre, a romantic epic entitled <i>King
Arthur</i>, of which he expected much, and he was greatly disappointed
by its apathetic reception. Having experienced some
rather acid criticism, questioning the morality of his novels, he
next essayed a form of fiction which he was determined should
leave no loophole to suspicion, and in <i>The Caxtons</i> (1849), published
at first anonymously, gave further proof of his versatility
and resource. <i>My Novel</i> (1853) and <i>What will he do with it?</i>
were designed to prolong the same strain.</p>

<p>In 1852 he entered the political field anew, and in the conservative
interest. He had differed from the policy of Lord John
Russell over the corn laws, and now separated finally from the
liberals. He stood for Hertfordshire and was elected, holding
the seat till 1866, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron
Lytton of Knebworth. His eloquence gave him the ear of the
House of Commons, and he often spoke with influence and
authority. In 1858 he was appointed secretary for the colonies.
In the House of Lords he was comparatively inactive. His
last novels were <i>A Strange Story</i> (1862), a mystical romance
with spiritualistic tendencies; <i>The Coming Race</i> (1871), <i>The
Parisians</i> (1873)&mdash;both unacknowledged at the time of his
death; and <i>Kenelm Chillingly</i>, which was in course of publication
in <i>Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine</i> when Lytton died at Torquay on the
18th of January 1873. The last three of his stories were classed
by his son, the 2nd Lord Lytton, as a trilogy, animated by a
common purpose, to exhibit the influence of modern ideas upon
character and conduct.</p>

<p>Bulwer-Lytton&rsquo;s attitude towards life was theatrical, the
language of his sentiments was artificial and over-decorated, and
the tone of his work was often so flamboyant as to give an impression
of false taste and judgment. Nevertheless, he built up
each of his stories upon a deliberate and careful framework:
he was assiduous according to his lights in historical research;
and conscientious in the details of workmanship. As the
fashion of his day has become obsolete the immediate appeal of
his work has diminished. It will always, however, retain its
interest, not only for the merits of certain individual novels,
but as a mirror of the prevailing intellectual movement of the
first half of the 19th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LYTTON, EDWARD ROBERT BULWER-LYTTON,<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Earl
of</span> (1831-1891), English diplomatist and poet, was the only son
of the 1st Baron Lytton. He was born in Hertford Street,
Mayfair, on the 8th of November 1831. Robert Lytton and his
sister were brought up as children principally by a Miss Green.
In 1840 the boy was sent to a school at Twickenham, in 1842
to another at Brighton, and in 1845 to Harrow. From his
earliest childhood Lytton read voraciously and wrote copiously,
quickly developing a genuine and intense love of literature and a
remarkable facility of expression. In 1849 he left Harrow and
studied for a year at Bonn with an English tutor, and on his
return with another tutor in England. In 1850 he entered the
diplomatic service as unpaid <i>attaché</i> to his uncle, Sir Henry
Bulwer, who was then minister at Washington. His advance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span>
in the diplomatic service was continuous, his successive appointments
being: as second secretary&mdash;1852, Florence; 1854,
Paris; 1857, The Hague; 1859, Vienna; as first secretary or
secretary of legation&mdash;1863, Copenhagen; 1864, Athens;
1865, Lisbon; 1868, Madrid; 1868, Vienna; 1873, Paris;
as minister&mdash;1875, Lisbon. In 1887 he was appointed to succeed
Lord Lyons as ambassador at Paris, and held that office until his
death in 1891. This rapid promotion from one European court
to another indicates the esteem in which Lytton was held by
successive foreign secretaries. In 1864, immediately before
taking up his appointment at Athens, he married Edith, daughter
of Edward Villiers, brother of the earl of Clarendon, and in 1873,
upon the death of his father, he succeeded to the peerage and the
estate of Knebworth in Hertfordshire.</p>

<p>Early in 1875 Lord Lytton declined an offer of appointment
as governor of Madras, and in November of that year he was
nominated governor-general of India by Disraeli. The moment
was critical in the history of India. In Central Asia the
advance of Russia had continued so steadily and so rapidly that
Shere Ali, the amir of Afghanistan, had determined to seek
safety as the vassal of the tsar. Lytton went out to India with
express instructions from the British government to recover the
friendship of the amir if possible, and if not so to arrange matters
on the north-west frontier as to be able to be indifferent to his
hostility. For eighteen months Lytton and his council made
every effort to conciliate the friendship of the amir, but when
a Russian agent was established at Kabul, while the mission of
Sir Neville Chamberlain was forcibly denied entrance into the
amir&rsquo;s dominions, no choice was left between acknowledging
the right of a subsidized ally of Great Britain to place himself
within Russian control and depriving him of the office which he
owed to British patronage and assistance. The inevitable war
began in November 1878, and by the close of that year the forces
prepared by Lytton for that purpose had achieved their task
with extraordinary accuracy and economy. Shere Ali fled from
Kabul, and shortly afterwards died, and once more it fell to the
Indian government to make provision for the future of Afghanistan.
By the treaty of Gandamak in May 1879 Yakub Khan,
a son of Shere Ali, was recognized as amir, the main conditions
agreed upon being that the districts of Kuram, Pishin and Sibi
should be &ldquo;assigned&rdquo; to British administration, and the Khyber
and other passes be under British control; that there should be
a permanent British Resident at Kabul, and that the amir should
be subsidized in an amount to be afterwards determined upon.
The endeavour of the Indian government was to leave the internal
administration of Afghanistan as little affected as possible,
but considerable risk was run in trusting so much, and especially
the safety of a British envoy, to the power and the goodwill of
Yakub Khan. Sir Louis Cavagnari, the British envoy entered
Kabul at the end of July, and was, with his staff, massacred
in the rising which took place on the 3rd of September. The
war of 1879-80 immediately began, with the occupation of
Kandahar by Stewart and the advance upon Kabul by Roberts,
and the military operations which followed were not concluded
when Lytton resigned his office in April 1880.</p>

<p>A complete account of Lytton&rsquo;s viceroyalty, and a lucid
exposition of the principles of his government and the main
outlines of his policy, may be found in <i>Lord Lytton&rsquo;s Indian
Administration</i>, by his daughter, Lady Betty Balfour (London,
1899). The frontier policy which he adopted, after the method
of a friendly and united Afghanistan under Yakub Khan had
been tried and had failed, was that the Afghan kingdom should be
destroyed. The province of Kandahar was to be occupied by
Great Britain, and administered by a vassal chief, Shere Ali Khan,
who was appointed &ldquo;Wali&rdquo; with a solemn guarantee of British
support (unconditionally withdrawn by the government succeeding
Lytton&rsquo;s). The other points of the Indian frontier were to
be made as secure as possible, and the provinces of Kabul and
Herat were to be left absolutely to their own devices. In consequence
of what had been said of Lytton by the leaders of the
parliamentary opposition in England, it was impossible for him
to retain his office under a government formed by them, and he
accordingly resigned at the same time as the Beaconsfield
ministry. This part of his policy was thereupon revoked. Abdur
Rahman, proving himself the strongest of the claimants to the
throne left vacant by Yakub Khan&rsquo;s deposition, became amir
as the subsidized ally of the Indian government.</p>

<p>The two most considerable events of Lytton&rsquo;s viceroyalty,
besides the Afghan wars, were the assumption by Queen Victoria
of the title of empress of India on the 1st of January 1877, and
the famine which prevailed in various parts of India in 1876-78.
He satisfied himself that periodical famines must be expected
in Indian history, and that constant preparation during years
of comparative prosperity was the only condition whereby
their destructiveness could be modified. Accordingly he obtained
the appointment of the famine commission of 1878, to inquire,
upon lines laid down by him, into available means of mitigation.
Their report, made in 1880, is the foundation of the later system
of irrigation, development of communications, and &ldquo;famine
insurance.&rdquo; The equalization and reduction of the salt duty
were effected, and the abolition of the cotton duty commenced,
during Lytton&rsquo;s term of office, and the system of Indian finance
profoundly modified by decentralization and the regulation
of provincial responsibility, in all which matters Lytton
enthusiastically supported Sir John Strachey, the financial
member of his council.</p>

<p>Upon Lytton&rsquo;s resignation in 1880 an earldom was conferred
upon him in recognition of his services as viceroy. He lived at
Knebworth until 1887, in which year he was appointed to succeed
Lord Lyons as ambassador at Paris. He died at Paris on the
24th of November 1891, of a clot of blood in the heart, when
apparently recovering from a serious illness. He was succeeded
by his son (b. 1876) as 2nd earl.</p>

<p>Lytton is probably better known as a poet&mdash;under the pen-name
of &ldquo;Owen Meredith&rdquo;&mdash;than as a statesman. The list
of his published works is as follows: <i>Clytemnestra, and other
Poems</i>, 1855; <i>The Wanderer</i>, 1858; <i>Lucile</i>, 1860; <i>Serbski
Pesme, or National Songs of Servia</i>, 1861, <i>Tannhäuser</i> (in
collaboration with Mr Julian Fane), 1861; <i>Chronicles and
Characters</i>, 1867; <i>Orval, or The Fool of Time</i>, 1868; <i>Fables
in Song</i> (2 vols.), 1874; <i>Glenaveril, or The Metamorphoses</i>, 1885;
<i>After Paradise, or the Legends of Exile, and other Poems</i>, 1887;
<i>Marah</i>, 1892; <i>King Poppy</i>, 1892. The two last-mentioned
volumes were published posthumously. A few previously
unpublished pieces are included in a volume of <i>Selections</i> published,
with an introduction by Lady Betty Balfour, in 1894.
His metrical style was easy and copious, but not precise. It
often gives the impression of having been produced with facility,
because the flow of his thought carried him along, and of not
having undergone prolonged or minute polish. It was frequently
suggestive of the work of other poets, especially in his earlier
productions. The friend who wrote the inscription for the
monument to be erected to him at St Paul&rsquo;s described him as
&ldquo;a poet of many styles, each the expression of his habitual
thoughts.&rdquo; <i>Lucile</i>, a novel in verse, presents a romantic style
and considerable wit; and <i>Glenaveril</i>, which also contains
many passages of great beauty and much poetic thought, has
much of the same narrative character. Besides his volumes
of poetry, Lytton published in 1883 two volumes of a biography
of his father. The second of these contains the beginning of the
elder Lytton&rsquo;s unfinished novel, <i>Greville</i>, and his life is brought
down only to the year 1832, when he was twenty-six years of
age, so that the completion of the book upon the same scale
would have required at least four more volumes. The executrix
of Lytton&rsquo;s mother chose to consider that the publication was
injurious to that lady&rsquo;s memory, and issued a volume purporting
to contain Bulwer-Lytton&rsquo;s letters to his wife. This Lytton
suppressed by injunction, thereby procuring a fresh exposition
of the law that the copyright in letters remains in the writer
or his representatives, though the property in them belongs
to the recipient. Lytton&rsquo;s appointment to the Parisian embassy
caused the biography of his father to be finally laid aside.</p>

in its earliest representations in Greek. The greater length
of the first limb of <i>m</i> is characteristic of the earliest forms. From
this form, written from left to right, the Latin abbreviation M&rsquo;
for the praenomen Manius is supposed to have developed, the
apostrophe representing the fifth stroke of the original letter.
In the early Greek alphabets the four-stroke M with legs of
equal length represents not <i>m</i> but <i>s</i>; <i>m</i> when written with four
strokes is <img style="width:23px; height:19px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img188b.jpg" alt="" />. The five-stroke forms, however, are confined
practically to Crete, Melos and Cumae; from the last named the
Romans received it along with the rest of their alphabet. The
Phoenician name of the symbol was <i>mem</i>, the Greek name <span class="grk" title="mû">&#956;&#8166;</span> is
formed on the analogy of the name for <i>n</i>. M represents the
bilabial nasal sound, which was generally voiced. It is commonly
a stable sound, but many languages, <i>e.g.</i> Greek, Germanic
and Celtic, change it when final into -<i>n</i>, its dental
correlative. It appears more frequently as an initial sound in
Greek and Latin than in the other languages of the same stock,
because in these <i>s</i> before <i>m</i> (as also before <i>l</i> and <i>n</i>) disappeared at
the beginning of words. The sounds <i>m</i> and <i>b</i> are closely related,
the only difference being that, in pronouncing <i>m</i>, the nasal passage
is not closed, thus allowing the sound to be prolonged,
while <i>b</i> is an instantaneous or explosive sound. In various
languages <i>b</i> is inserted between <b>m</b> and a following consonant,
as in the Gr. <span class="grk" title="mesêmbria">&#956;&#949;&#963;&#951;&#956;&#946;&#961;&#943;&#945;</span> &ldquo;mid-day,&rdquo; or the English &ldquo;number,&rdquo;

<i>e.g.</i> the <span class="correction" title="amended from Enghlish">English</span> word <i>fathom</i> comes from an Anglo-Saxon <i>faþm</i>,
where the <i>m</i> was so used. (For more details as to this phonetic

Pop. (1903), 8011. It rose into importance as a fishing harbour
towards the end of the 16th century, and its prosperity rapidly
increased after the opening of the New Waterway (the Maas

in 1572 by Philip of Marnix, lord of St Aldegonde, was captured
by the Spanish in 1573.</p>

of the Maas at the influx of the river Geer, 19 m. by rail N.N.E.
of Liége in Belgium. Pop. (1904), 36,146. A small portion of
the town, known as Wyk, lies on the right bank. A stone
bridge connecting the two replaced a wooden structure as early
as 1280, and was rebuilt in 1683. Formerly a strong fortress,
Maastricht is still a considerable garrison town, but its ramparts
were dismantled in 1871-1878. The town-hall, built by Pieter
Post and completed in 1683, contains some interesting pictures
and tapestry. The old town-hall (Oud Stadhuis), a Gothic
building of the 15th century, is now used as a museum of
antiquities. The church of St Servatius is said to have been
founded by Bishop Monulphus in the 6th century, thus being
the oldest church in Holland; according to one account it
was rebuilt and enlarged as early as the time of Charlemagne.
The crypt with the tomb of the patron saint dates from the
original building. The varied character of its late Romanesque
and later Gothic architecture bears evidence of the frequency
with which the church has been restored and altered. Over
the porch is the fine emperor&rsquo;s hall, and the church has a
marble statue of Charlemagne. The church of Our Lady, a
late Romanesque building, has two ancient crypts and a 13th-century
choir of exceptional beauty, but the nave suffered
severely from a restoration in 1764. The present Gothic
building of St Martin (in Wyk) was erected in 1859; the
original church is said by tradition to have occupied the site
of an old heathen temple. The Protestant St Janskerk, a
Gothic building of the 13th and 15th centuries, with a fine
tower, was formerly the baptistery of the cathedral. The
various hospitals, the poor-house, the orphanage and most of
the other charitable foundations are Roman Catholic institutions.
Maastricht contains the provincial archives, a library and
geological collections. Though mainly indebted for its commercial
prosperity to its position on the river, the town did
not begin to reap the full advantages of its situation till the
opening of the railways between 1853 and 1865. At first a
trade was carried on in wine, colonial wares, alcoholic liquors
and salt; there are now manufactures of earthenware, glass and
crystal, arms, paper, woollens, tools, lead, copper and zinc work,
as well as breweries, and tobacco and cigar factories, and a trade
in corn and butter.</p>

<p>A short distance south of Maastricht are the great sandstone
quarries of Pietersberg, which were worked from the time of the
Romans to near the end of the 19th century; the result is one of
the most extraordinary subterranean labyrinths in the world,
estimated to cover an area 15 m. by 9 m. In the time of the
Spanish wars these underground passages served to hide the
peasants and their cattle.</p>

<p>Maastricht was originally the <i>trajectus superior</i> (upper ford)
of the Romans, and was the seat of a bishop from 382 to 721.
Having formed part of the Frankish realm, it was ruled after
1204 jointly by the dukes of Brabant and the prince-bishops
of Liége. In 1579 it was besieged by the Spaniards under the
duke of Parma, being captured and plundered after a heroic
resistance. It was taken by the French in 1673, 1748 and
1794.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MABILLON, JOHN<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> (1632-1707), Benedictine monk of the
Congregation of St Maur (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Maurists</a></span>), was the son of a
peasant near Reims. In 1653 he became a monk in the abbey
of St Remi at Reims. In 1664 he was placed at St Germain-des-Prés
in Paris, the great literary workshop of the Maurists, where
he lived and worked for twenty years, at first under d&rsquo;Achery,
with whom he edited the nine folio volumes of Acta of the
Benedictine Saints. In Mabillon&rsquo;s Prefaces (reprinted separately)
these lives were for the first time made to illustrate the ecclesiastical
and civil history of the early middle ages. Mabillon&rsquo;s
masterpiece was the <i>De re diplomatica</i> (1681; and a supplement,
1704) in which were first laid down the principles for determining
the authenticity and date of medieval charters and manuscripts.
It practically created the science of Latin palaeography, and
is still the standard work on the subject. In 1685-1686 Mabillon
visited the libraries of Italy, to purchase MSS. and books for
the King&rsquo;s Library. On his return to Paris he was called upon
to defend against de Rancé, the abbot of La Trappe, the legitimacy
for monks of the kind of studies to which the Maurists devoted
themselves: this called forth Mabillon&rsquo;s <i>Traité des études
monastiques</i> and his <i>Réflexions sur la réponse de M. l&rsquo;abbé de la</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>189</span>
<i>Trappe</i> (1691-1692), works embodying the ideas and programme
of the Maurists for ecclesiastical studies. Mabillon produced
in all some twenty folio volumes and as many of lesser size, nearly
all works of monumental erudition (the chief are named in the
article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Maurists</a></span>). A very competent judge declared that,
&ldquo;he knew well the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th centuries, but
nothing earlier or later.&rdquo; Mabillon never allowed his studies
to interfere with his life as a monk; he was noted for his regular
attendance at the choral recitation of the office and the other
duties of the monastic life, and for his deep personal religion,
as well as for a special charm of character. He died on the 26th
of December 1707, in the midst of the production of the colossal
Benedictine Annals.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MABUSE, JAN<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> (d. 1532), the name adopted (from his birthplace,
Maubeuge) by the Flemish painter <span class="sc">Jenni Gosart</span>, or
<span class="sc">Jennyn van Hennegouwe</span> (Hainault), as he called himself
when he matriculated in the gild of St Luke, at Antwerp, in 1503.
We know nothing of his early life, but his works tell us that he
stood in his first period under the influence of artists to whom
plastic models were familiar; and this leads to the belief that he
spent his youth on the French border rather than on the banks
of the Scheldt. Without the subtlety or power of Van der
Weyden, he had this much in common with the great master of
Tournai and Brussels, that his compositions were usually framed
in architectural backgrounds. But whilst Mabuse thus early
betrays his dependence on the masters of the French frontier,
he also confesses admiration for the great painters who first
gave lustre to Antwerp; and in the large altar-pieces of Castle
Howard and Scawby he combines in a quaint and not unskilful
medley the sentiment of Memling, the bright and decided contrasts
of pigment peculiar to coloured reliefs, the cornered and
packed drapery familiar to Van der Weyden, and the bold but
Socratic cast of face remarkable in the works of Quentin Matsys.
At Scawby he illustrates the legend of the count of Toulouse,
who parted with his <span class="correction" title="amended from wordly">worldly</span> goods to assume the frock of a
hermit. At Castle Howard he represents the Adoration of the
Kings, and throws together some thirty figures on an architectural
background, varied in detail, massive in shape and fanciful in
ornament. He surprises us by pompous costume and flaring
contrasts of tone. His figures, like pieces on a chess-board,
are often rigid and conventional. The landscape which shows
through the colonnades is adorned with towers and steeples in
the minute fashion of Van der Weyden. After a residence of a
few years at Antwerp, Mabuse took service with Philip, bastard
of Philip the Good, at that time lord of Somerdyk and admiral
of Zeeland. One of his pictures had already become celebrated&mdash;a
Descent from the Cross (50 figures), on the high altar of the
monastery of St Michael of Tongerloo. Philip of Burgundy
ordered Mabuse to execute a replica for the church of Middelburg;
and the value which was then set on the picture is apparent
from the fact that Dürer came expressly to Middelburg (1521) to
see it. In 1568 the altar-piece perished by fire. In 1508 Mabuse
accompanied Philip of Burgundy on his Italian mission; and by
this accident an important revolution was effected in the art of
the Netherlands. Mabuse appears to have chiefly studied in
Italy the cold and polished works of the Leonardesques. He not
only brought home a new style, but he also introduced the fashion
of travelling to Italy; and from that time till the age of Rubens
and Van Dyck it was considered proper that all Flemish painters
should visit the peninsula. The Flemings grafted Italian
mannerisms on their own stock; and the cross turned out so
unfortunately that for a century Flemish art lost all trace of
originality.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1509 Philip returned to the Netherlands,
and, retiring to his seat of Suytburg in Zeeland, surrendered
himself to the pleasures of planning decorations for his castle
and ordering pictures of Mabuse and Jacob of Barbari. Being
in constant communication with the court of Margaret of Austria
at Malines, he gave the artists in his employ fair chances of promotion.
Barbari was made court painter to the regent, whilst
Mabuse received less important commissions. Records prove
that Mabuse painted a portrait of Leonora of Portugal, and
other small pieces, for Charles V. in 1516. But his only signed
pictures of this period are the Neptune and Amphitrite of 1516
at Berlin, and the Madonna, with a portrait of Jean Carondelet
of 1517, at the Louvre, in both of which we clearly discern that
Vasari only spoke by hearsay of the progress made by Mabuse in
&ldquo;the true method of producing pictures full of nude figures and
poesies.&rdquo; It is difficult to find anything more coarse or misshapen
than the Amphitrite, unless we except the grotesque and ungainly
drayman who figures for Neptune. In later forms of the
same subject&mdash;the Adam and Eve at Hampton Court, or its
feebler replica at Berlin&mdash;we observe more nudity, combined
with realism of the commonest type. Happily, Mabuse was
capable of higher efforts. His St Luke painting the portrait of
the Virgin in Sanct Veit at Prague, a variety of the same subject
in the Belvedere at Vienna, the Madonna of the Baring collection
in London, or the numerous repetitions of Christ and the scoffers
(Ghent and Antwerp), all prove that travel had left many of
Mabuse&rsquo;s fundamental peculiarities unaltered. His figures still
retain the character of stone; his architecture is as rich and
varied, his tones are as strong as ever. But bright contrasts of
gaudy tints are replaced by soberer greys; and a cold haze, the
<i>sfumato</i> of the Milanese, pervades the surfaces. It is but seldom
that these features fail to obtrude. When they least show, the
master displays a brilliant palette combined with smooth surface
and incisive outlines. In this form the Madonnas of Munich
and Vienna (1527), the likeness of a girl weighing gold pieces
(Berlin), and the portraits of the children of the king of Denmark
at Hampton Court, are fair specimens of his skill. As early as
1523, when Christian II. of Denmark came to Belgium, he asked
Mabuse to paint the likenesses of his dwarfs. In 1528 he requested
the artist to furnish to Jean de Hare the design for his queen
Isabella&rsquo;s tomb in the abbey of St Pierre near Ghent. It was no
doubt at this time that Mabuse completed the portraits of John,
Dorothy and Christine, children of Christian II., which came into
the collection of Henry VIII. No doubt, also, these portraits
are identical with those of three children at Hampton Court,
which were long known and often copied as likenesses of Prince
Arthur, Prince Henry and Princess Margaret of England. One
of the copies at Wilton, inscribed with the forged name of &ldquo;Hans
Holbein, ye father,&rdquo; and the false date of 1495, has often been
cited as a proof that Mabuse came to England in the reign of
Henry VII.; but the statement rests on no foundation whatever.
At the period when these portraits were executed Mabuse lived
at Middelburg. But he dwelt at intervals elsewhere. When
Philip of Burgundy became bishop of Utrecht, and settled at
Duerstede, near Wyck, in 1517, he was accompanied by Mabuse,
who helped to decorate the new palace of his master. At
Philip&rsquo;s death, in 1524, Mabuse designed and erected his tomb
in the church of Wyck. He finally retired to Middelburg, where
he took service with Philip&rsquo;s brother, Adolph, lord of Veeren.
Van Mander&rsquo;s biography accuses Mabuse of habitual drunkenness;
yet it describes the splendid appearance of the artist as, dressed
in gold brocade, he accompanied Lucas of Leyden on a pleasure
trip to Ghent, Malines and Antwerp in 1527. The works of
Mabuse are those of a hardworking and patient artist; the number
of his still extant pictures practically demonstrates that he
was not a debauchee. The marriage of his daughter with the
painter Henry Van der Heyden of Louvain proves that he had
a home, and did not live habitually in taverns, as Van Mander
suggests. His death at Antwerp, on the 1st of October 1532, is
recorded in the portrait engraved by Jerome Cock.</p>

English literature are John Webster and Cyril Tourneur, with
E. A. Poe and R. L. Stevenson. The word has gained its significance
from its use in French, <i>la danse macabre</i>, for that allegorical
representation, in painting, sculpture and tapestry,
of the ever-present and universal power of death, known in
English as the &ldquo;Dance of Death,&rdquo; and in German as <i>Totentanz</i>.
The typical form which the allegory takes is that of a series of
pictures, sculptured or painted, in which Death appears, either
as a dancing skeleton or as a shrunken corpse wrapped in grave-clothes
to persons representing every age and condition of life,
and leads them all in a dance to the grave. Of the numerous
examples painted or sculptured on the walls of cloisters or churchyards
through medieval Europe few remain except in woodcuts
and engravings. Thus the famous series at Basel, originally
at the Klingenthal, a nunnery in Little Basel, dated from the
beginning of the 14th century. In the middle of the 15th century
this was moved to the churchyard of the Predigerkloster
at Basel, and was restored, probably by Hans Kluber, in 1568;
the fall of the wall in 1805 reduced it to fragments, and only
drawings of it remain. A Dance of Death in its simplest form
still survives in the Marienkirche at Lübeck in a 15th-century
painting on the walls of a chapel. Here there are twenty-four
figures in couples, between each is a dancing Death linking the
groups by outstretched hands, the whole ring being led by a
Death playing on a pipe. At Dresden there is a sculptured life-size
series in the old Neustädter Kirchhoff, removed here from
the palace of Duke George in 1701 after a fire. At Rouen in
the <i>aitre</i> (atrium) or cloister of St Maclou there also remains a
sculptured <i>danse macabre</i>. There was a celebrated fresco of
the subject in the cloister of Old St Paul&rsquo;s in London, and another
in the now destroyed Hungerford Chapel at Salisbury, of which
a single woodcut, &ldquo;Death and the Gallant,&rdquo; alone remains.
Of the many engraved reproductions, the most celebrated is the
series drawn by Holbein. Here the long ring of connected
dancing couples is necessarily abandoned, and the Dance of
Death becomes rather a series of <i>imagines mortis</i>.</p>

<p>Concerning the origin of this allegory in painting and sculpture
there has been much dispute. It certainly seems to be as early
as the 14th century, and has often been attributed to the overpowering
consciousness of the presence of death due to the Black
Death and the miseries of the Hundred Years&rsquo; War. It has also
been attributed to a form of the Morality, a dramatic dialogue
between Death and his victims in every station of life, ending in a
dance off the stage (see Du Cange, <i>Gloss.</i>, <i>s.v.</i> &ldquo;Machabaeorum
chora&rdquo;). The origin of the peculiar form the allegory has taken
has also been found, somewhat needlessly and remotely, in the
dancing skeletons on late Roman sarcophagi and mural paintings
at Cumae or Pompeii, and a false connexion has been traced with
the &ldquo;Triumph of Death,&rdquo; attributed to Orcagna, in the Campo
Santo at Pisa.</p>

<p>The etymology of the word <i>macabre</i> is itself most obscure.
According to Gaston Paris (<i>Romania</i>, xxiv., 131; 1895) it first
occurs in the form <i>macabre</i> in Jean le Févre&rsquo;s <i>Respit de la mort</i>
(1376), &ldquo;Je lis de Macabré la danse,&rdquo; and he takes this accented
form to be the true one, and traces it in the name of the first
painter of the subject. The more usual explanation is based
on the Latin name, <i>Machabaeorum chora</i>. The seven tortured
brothers, with their mother and Eleazar (2 Macc. vi., vii.) were
prominent figures on this hypothesis in the supposed dramatic
dialogues. Other connexions have been suggested, as for example
with St Macarius, or Macaire, the hermit, who, according to
Vasari, is to be identified with the figure pointing to the decaying
corpses in the Pisan &ldquo;Triumph of Death,&rdquo; or with an Arabic
word <i>magbarah</i>, &ldquo;cemetery.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">McADAM, JOHN LOUDON<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> (1756-1836), Scottish inventor,
who gave his name to the system of road-making known as
&ldquo;macadamizing,&rdquo; was born at Ayr, Scotland, on the 21st of
September 1756, being descended on his father&rsquo;s side from the
clan of the McGregors. While at school he constructed a model
road-section. In 1770 he went to New York, entering the
counting-house of a merchant uncle. He returned to Scotland
with a considerable fortune in 1783, and purchased an estate at
Sauhrie, Ayrshire. Among other public offices he held that of
road trustee. The highways of Great Britain were at this time
in a very bad condition, and McAdam at once began to consider
how to effect reforms. At his own expense he began at Sauhrie,
despite much opposition, a series of experiments in road-making.
In 1798 he removed to Falmouth, where he had received a
government appointment, and continued his experiments there.
His general conclusion was that roads should be constructed of
broken stone (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Roads</a></span>). In 1815, having been appointed
surveyor-general of the Bristol roads, he was able to put his
theories into practice. In 1819 he published a <i>Practical Essay
on the Scientific Repair and Preservation of Roads</i>, followed, in
1820, by the <i>Present State of Road-making</i>. As the result of a
parliamentary inquiry in 1823 into the whole question of road-making,
his views were adopted by the public authorities, and
in 1827 he was appointed general surveyor of roads. In pursuing
his investigations he had travelled over thirty thousand
miles of road and expended over £5000. Parliament recouped
him for his expenses and gave him a handsome gratuity, but he
declined a proffered knighthood. He died at Moffat, Dumfriesshire,
on the 26th of November 1836.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACAIRE,<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> a French <i>chanson de geste</i>. <i>Macaire</i> (12th century)
and <i>La reine Sibille</i> (14th century) are two versions of the story
of the false accusation brought against the queen of Charlemagne,
called Blanchefleur in <i>Macaire</i> and Sibille in the later poem.
<i>Macaire</i> is only preserved in the Franco-Venetian <i>geste</i> of Charlemagne
(Bibl. St Mark MS. fr. xiii.). <i>La Reine Sibille</i> only exists
in fragments, but the tale is given in the chronicle of Alberic
Trium Fontium and in a prose version. <i>Macaire</i> is the product
of the fusion of two legends: that of the unjustly repudiated
wife and that of the dog who detects the murderer of his master.
For the former motive see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Geneviève of Brabant</a></span>. The
second is found in Plutarch, <i>Script. moral.</i>, ed. Didot ii. (1186),
where a dog, like Aubri&rsquo;s hound, stayed three days without
food by the body of its master, and subsequently attacked the
murderers, thus leading to their discovery. The duel between
Macaire and the dog is paralleled by an interpolation by Giraldus
Cambrensis in a MS. of the <i>Hexameron</i> of Saint Ambrose. Aubri&rsquo;s
hound received the name of the &ldquo;dog of Montargis,&rdquo; because a
representation of the story was painted on a chimney-piece in
the château of Montargis in the 15th century. The tale was
early divorced from Carolingian tradition, and Jean de la Taille,
in his <i>Discours notable des duels</i> (Paris, 1607), places the incident
under Charles V.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACALPINE<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Maccabeus</span>), <span class="bold">JOHN</span> (d. 1557), Protestant
theologian, was born in Scotland about the beginning of the
16th century, and graduated at some Scottish university. From
1532 to 1534 he was prior of the Dominican convent of Perth;
but having in the latter year been summoned with Alexander
Ales (<i>q.v.</i>) and others to answer for heresy before the bishop
of Ross, he fled to England, where he was granted letters of
denization on the 7th of April 1537, and married Agnes Macheson,
a fellow-exile for religion; her sister Elizabeth became the wife
of Miles Coverdale. The reaction of 1539 made England a
doubtful refuge, and on the 25th of November 1540 Macalpine
matriculated at the university of Wittenberg. He had already
graduated B.A. at Cologne, and in 1542 proceeded to his doctorate
at Wittenberg. In that year, being now known as Maccabeus,
he accepted Christian III.&rsquo;s offer of the chair of theology at the
university of Copenhagen, which had been endowed out of the
spoils of the Church. Melanchthon spoke well of Macalpine, and
with Peter Plade (Palladius), who had also studied at Wittenberg,
Macalpine took a prominent part in building up the Lutheran
Church of Denmark. A joint exposure by Plade and Macalpine
of Osiander&rsquo;s errors was published in 1552 and reprinted at
Leipzig and Copenhagen in 1768; and Macalpine was one of the
four translators of Luther&rsquo;s German Bible into Danish. He
also encouraged Sir David Lindsay, who visited him in 1548, to
publish his <i>Monarchie</i>, and persuaded Christian III. to intercede
with Queen Mary Tudor on behalf of Coverdale and
invite him to Denmark. Macalpine died at Copenhagen on
the 6th of December 1557.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACAO<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> (A-Ma-ngao, &ldquo;Harbour of the goddess A-Ma&rdquo;;
Port. <i>Macau</i>), a Portuguese settlement on the coast of China, in
22° N., 132° E. Pop. (1896), Chinese, 74,568; Portuguese, 3898;
other nationalities, 161&mdash;total, 78,627. It consists of a tongue of
land 2½ m. in length and less than 1 m. in breadth, running
S.S.W. from the island of Hiang Shang (Port. <i>Ançam</i>) on the
western side of the estuary of the Canton River. Bold and rocky
hills about 300 ft. high occupy both extremities of the peninsula,
the picturesque city, with its flat-roofed houses painted blue,
green and red, lying in the undulating ground between. The
forts are effective additions to the general view, but do not add
much to the strength of the place. Along the east side of the
peninsula runs the Praya Grande, or Great Quay, the chief
promenade in Macao, on which stand the governor&rsquo;s palace,
the administrative offices, the consulates and the leading
commercial establishments. The church of St Paul (1594-1602),
the seat of the Jesuit college in the 17th century, was destroyed
by fire in 1835. The Hospital da Misericordia (1569) was rebuilt
in 1640. The Camoens grotto, where the exiled poet found
leisure to celebrate the achievements of his ungrateful country,
lies in a secluded spot to the north of the town, which has been
partly left in its native wildness strewn with huge granite
boulders and partly transformed into a fine botanical garden.
During the south-west (summer) monsoon great quantities
(67 in.) of rain fall, especially in July and August. The mean
temperature is 74.3° F.; in July, the hottest month, the
temperature is 84.2°; in February, the coldest, it is 59°. On
the whole the climate is moist. Hurricanes are frequent. Of
the Portuguese inhabitants more than three-fourths are natives
of Macao&mdash;a race very inferior in point of physique to their
European ancestors. Macao is connected with Hong-Kong by
a daily steamer. Being open to the south-west sea breezes, it
is a favourite place of resort from the oppressive heat of Hong-Kong.
It is ruled by a governor, and, along with Timor (East
Indies), constitutes a bishopric, to which belong also the
Portuguese Christians in Malacca and Singapore. Though
most of the land is under garden cultivation, the mass of the
people is dependent more or less directly on mercantile pursuits;
for, while the exclusive policy both of Chinese and Portuguese
which prevented Macao becoming a free port till 1845-1846
allowed what was once the great emporium of European
commerce in eastern Asia to be outstripped by its younger and
more liberal rivals, the local, though not the foreign, trade of
the place is still of very considerable extent. Since the middle
of the 19th century, indeed, much of it has run in the most
questionable channels; the nefarious coolie traffic gradually
increased in extent and in cruelty from about 1848 till it was
prohibited in 1874, and much of the actual trade is more or less
of the nature of smuggling. The commodities otherwise mostly
dealt in are opium, tea, rice, oil, raw cotton, fish and silk.
The total value of exports and imports was in 1876-1877 upwards
of £1,536,000. In 1880 it had increased to £2,259,250, and in
1898 to £3,771,615. Commercial intercourse is most intimate
with Hong-Kong, Canton, Batavia and Goa. The preparation
and packing of tea is the principal industry in the town. In
fishing a large number of boats and men are employed.</p>

<p>In 1557 the Portuguese were permitted to erect factories on
the peninsula, and in 1573 the Chinese built across the isthmus
the wall which still cuts off the barbarian from the rest of the
island. Jesuit missionaries established themselves on the spot;
and in 1580 Gregory XIII. constituted a bishopric of Macao.
A senate was organized in 1583, and in 1628 Jeronimo de Silveira
became first royal governor of Macao. Still the Portuguese
remained largely under the control of the Chinese, who had
never surrendered their territorial rights and maintained their
authority by means of mandarins&mdash;these insisting that even
European criminals should be placed in their hands. Ferreira
do Amaral, the Portuguese governor, put an end to this state of
things in 1849, and left the Chinese officials no more authority
in the peninsula than the representatives of other foreign
nations; and, though his antagonists procured his assassination
(Aug. 22), his successors succeeded in carrying out his policy.</p>

<p>Although Macao is de facto a colonial possession of Portugal,
the Chinese government persistently refused to recognize the
claim of the Portuguese to territorial rights, alleging that they
were merely lessees or tenants at will, and until 1849 the Portuguese
paid to the Chinese an annual rent of £71 per annum.
This diplomatic difficulty prevented the conclusion of a commercial
treaty between China and Portugal for a long time, but an
arrangement for a treaty was come to in 1887 on the following
basis: (1) China confirmed perpetual occupation and government
of Macao and its dependencies by Portugal; (2) Portugal
engaged never to alienate Macao and its dependencies without
the consent of China; (3) Portugal engaged to co-operate in
opium revenue work at Macao in the same way as Great
Britain at Hong-Kong. The formal treaty was signed in the
same year, and arrangements were made whereby the Chinese
imperial customs were able to collect duties on vessels trading
with Macao in the same way as they had already arranged for
their collection at the British colony of Hong-Kong. For a
short time in 1802, and again in 1808, Macao was occupied by
the English as a precaution against seizure by the French.</p>

Displaying great variability in the length of the tail, which is

over India and Ceylon, thence northward to Tibet, and eastwards

more important species, typifying distinct sub-generic groups,

macaques go about in large troops, each headed by an old

some of the species are largely terrestrial, the Barbary ape is
wholly so. Docile and easily tamed when young, old males of
many of the species become exceedingly morose and savage in
captivity.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACARONI<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> (from dialectic Ital. <i>maccare</i>, to bruise or crush),
a preparation of a glutinous wheat originally peculiar to Italy,
where it is an article of food of national importance. The same
substance in different forms is also known as <i>vermicelli</i>, <i>pasta</i> or
Italian pastes, <i>spaghetti</i>, <i>taglioni</i>, <i>fanti</i>, &amp;c. These substances
are prepared from the hard, semi-translucent varieties of wheat
which are largely cultivated in the south of Europe, Algeria and
other warm regions, and distinguished by the Italians as <i>grano
duro</i> or <i>grano da semolino</i>. These wheats are much richer in
gluten and other nitrogenous compounds than the soft or tender
wheats of more northern regions, and their preparations are
more easily preserved. The various preparations are met with
as fine thin threads (vermicelli), thin sticks and pipes (spaghetti,
macaroni), small lozenges, stars, disks, ellipses, &amp;c. (pastes).
These various forms are prepared in a uniform manner from a
granular product of hard wheat, which, under the name of
semolina or middlings, is a commercial article. The semolina
is thoroughly mixed with boiling water and incorporated
in a kneading machine, such as is used in bakeries, into a stiff
paste or dough. It is then further kneaded by passing frequently
between rollers or under edge runners, till a homogeneous mass
has been produced which is placed in a strong steam-jacketed
cylinder, the lower end of which is closed with a thick disk
pierced with openings corresponding with the diameter or section
of the article to be made. Into this cylinder an accurately
fitting plunger or piston is introduced and subjected to very
great pressure, which causes the stiff dough to squeeze out through
the openings in the disk in continuous threads, sticks or pipes,
as the case may be. Vermicelli is cut off in short bundles and
laid on trays to dry, while macaroni is dried by hanging it in
longer lengths over wooden rods in stoves or heated apartments
through which currents of air are driven. It is only genuine
macaroni, rich in gluten, which can be dried in this manner;
spurious fabrications will not bear their own weight, and must,
therefore, be laid out flat to be dried. In making pastes the
cylinder is closed with a disk pierced with holes having the sectional
form of the pastes, and a set of knives revolving close against
the external surface of the disk cut off the paste in thin sections
as it exudes from each opening. True macaroni can be distinguished
by observing the flattened mark of the rod over
which it has been dried within the bend of the tubes; it has a soft
yellowish colour, is rough in texture, elastic and hard, and
breaks with a smooth glassy fracture. In boiling it swells up to
double its original size without becoming pasty or adhesive. It
can be kept any length of time without alteration or deterioration;
and it is on that account, in many circumstances, a most
convenient as well as a highly nutritious and healthful article of
food.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACARONICS,<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> a species of burlesque poetry, in which words
from a modern vernacular, with Latin endings, are introduced
into Latin verse, so as to produce a ridiculous effect. Sometimes
Greek is used instead of Latin. Tisi degli Odassi issued a <i>Carmen
macaronicum de Patavinis</i> in 1490. The real founder of the
practice, however, was Teofilo Folengo (1491-1544), whose mock-heroic
<i>Liber Macaronices</i> appeared in 1517. Folengo (<i>q.v.</i>) was
a Benedictine monk, who escaped from his monastery and wandered
through Italy, living a dissolute life, and supporting
himself by his absurd verses, which he described as an attempt to
produce in literature something like macaroni, a gross, rude and
rustic mixture of flour, cheese and butter. He wrote under the
pseudonym of Merlinus Coccaius, and his poem is an elaborate
burlesque epic, in twenty-five books, or <i>macaronea</i>; it is an
extraordinary medley of chivalrous feats, ridiculous and squalid
adventures, and satirical allegory. Its effect upon the mind of
Rabelais was so extraordinary that no examination of <i>Pantagruel</i>
can be complete without a reference to it (cf. <i>Gargantua</i>, i. 19).
It was immediately imitated in Italy by a number of minor
poets; and in France a writer whose real name was Antoine de la
Sablé, but who called himself Antonius de Arena (d. 1544),
published at Avignon in 1573 a <i>Meygra entrepriza</i>, which was
a burlesque account of Charles V.&rsquo;s disastrous campaign in
Provence. Folengo in Italy and Arena in France are considered
as the macaronic classics. In the 17th century, Joannes Caecilius
Frey (1580-1631) published a <i>Recitus veritabilis</i>, on a skirmish
between the vine-growers of Rueil and the bowmen of Paris.
Great popularity was achieved later still by an anonymous
macaronic, entitled <i>Funestissimus trepassus Micheli Morini</i>,
who died by falling off the branch of an elm-tree:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>De branche in brancham degringolat, et faciens pouf</p>
<p>Ex ormo cadit, et clunes obvertit Olympo.</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">Molière employed macaronic verse in the ceremonial scene with
the doctors in <i>Le Malade imaginaire</i>. Works in macaronic
prose are rarer. An <i>Anti-Clopinus</i> by Antony Hotman may be
mentioned and the amusing <i>Epistolae obscurorum virorum</i> (1515).
Macaronic prose was not unknown as an artifice of serious
oratory, and abounds (<i>e.g.</i>) in the sermons of Michel Menot
(1440-1518), who says of the prodigal son, <i>Emit sibi pulcheras
caligas d&rsquo;écarlate, bien tirées</i>.</p>

<p>The use of true macaronics has never been frequent in Great
Britain, where the only prominent example of it is the <i>Polemo-Middinia</i>
ascribed to William Drummond of Hawthornden.
This short epic was probably composed early in the 17th century,
but was not published until 1684. The <i>Polemo-Middinia</i>

Macarsca is a port of call for the Austrian Lloyd steamers,
and has a brisk trade in wine, grain and fruit. Under the name
of <i>Mocrum</i>, Macarsca was a thriving Roman city, and a bishopric
until 639, when it was destroyed by the Avars. In the 10th
century it is mentioned by Constantine Porphyrogenitus as a
city of the pagan Narentines. Its bishopric was revived in
1320, but the bishops resided at Almissa. In 1481 the city was
purchased from the duke of Herzegovina by Venice; in 1499
it was conquered by the Turks; and in 1646, after a successful
revolt, it again welcomed the sovereignty of Venice. The see
of Macarsca was merged in that of Spalato in 1830.</p>

was descended from an old Scottish family, the Macartneys of
Auchinleck, who had settled in 1649 at Lissanoure, Antrim,
Ireland, where he was born on the 14th of May 1737. After
graduating at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1759, he became a
student of the Temple, London. Through Stephen Fox, elder
brother of C. J. Fox, he was taken up by Lord Holland.
Appointed envoy extraordinary to Russia in 1764, he succeeded
in negotiating an alliance between England and that country.
After occupying a seat in the English parliament, he was in
1769 returned for Antrim in the Irish parliament, in order to
discharge the duties of chief secretary for Ireland. On resigning
this office he was knighted. In 1775 he became governor of
the Caribbee Islands (being created an Irish baron in 1776),
and in 1780 governor of Madras, but he declined the governor-generalship
of India, and returned to England in 1786. After
being created Earl Macartney in the Irish peerage (1792), he
was appointed the first envoy of Britain to China. On his
return from a confidential mission to Italy (1795) he was raised
to the English peerage as a baron in 1796, and in the end of the
same year was appointed governor of the newly acquired territory
of the Cape of Good Hope, where he remained till ill health
compelled him to resign in November 1798. He died at Chiswick,
Middlesex, on the 31st of May 1806, the title becoming extinct,
and his property, after the death of his widow (daughter of the
3rd earl of Bute), going to his niece, whose son took the name.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACAULAY, THOMAS BABINGTON MACAULAY,<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron</span>
(1800-1859), English historian, essayist and politician, was born
at Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, on the 25th of October 1800.
His father, Zachary Macaulay (1768-1838), had been governor
of Sierra Leone, and was in 1800 secretary to the chartered company
which had founded that colony; an ardent philanthropist,
he did much to secure the abolition of the slave trade, and he
edited the abolitionist organ, the <i>Christian Observer</i>, for many
years. Happy in his home, the son at a very early age gave
proof of a determined bent towards literature. Before he was
eight years of age he had written a <i>Compendium of Universal
History</i>, which gave a tolerably connected view of the leading
events from the creation to 1800, and a romance in the style of
Scott, in three cantos, called <i>The Battle of Cheviot</i>. A little
later he composed a long poem on the history of Olaus Magnus,
and a vast pile of blank verse entitled <i>Fingal, a Poem in Twelve
Books</i>. After being at a private school, in October 1818 young
Macaulay went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he afterwards
became a fellow. He gained in 1824 a college prize for
an essay on the character of William III. He also won a prize
for Latin declamation and a Craven scholarship, and wrote the
prize poems of 1819 and 1821.</p>

<p>In 1826 Macaulay was called to the bar and joined the northern
circuit. But he soon gave up even the pretence of reading law,
and spent many more hours under the gallery of the house of
commons than in the court. His first attempt at a public
speech, made at an anti-slavery meeting in 1824, was described
by the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> as &ldquo;a display of eloquence of rare
and matured excellence.&rdquo; His first considerable appearance
in print was in No. 1 of Knight&rsquo;s <i>Quarterly Magazine</i>, a
periodical which enjoyed a short but brilliant existence, and
which was largely supported by Eton and Cambridge. In
August 1825 began Macaulay&rsquo;s connexion with the periodical
which was to prove the field of his literary reputation. The
<i>Edinburgh Review</i> was at this time at the height of its power,
not only as an organ of the growing opinion which, leant towards
reform, but as a literary tribunal from which there was no
appeal. His essay on Milton (Aug. 1825), so crude that the
author afterwards said that &ldquo;it contained scarcely a paragraph
such as his matured judgment approved,&rdquo; created for him at
once a literary reputation which suffered no diminution to the
last, a reputation which he established and confirmed, but
which it would have been hardly possible to make more
conspicuous. The publisher John Murray declared that it
would be worth the copyright of <i>Childe Harold</i> to have Macaulay
on the staff of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, and Robert Hall, the
orator, writhing with pain, and well-nigh worn out with disease,
was discovered lying on the floor employed in learning by aid
of grammar and dictionary enough Italian to enable him to
verify the parallel between Milton and Dante.</p>

<p>This sudden blaze of popularity, kindled by a single essay,
is partly to be explained by the dearth of literary criticism in
England at that epoch. For, though a higher note had already
been sounded by Hazlitt and Coleridge, it had not yet taken hold
of the public mind, which was still satisfied with the feeble
appreciations of the <i>Retrospective Review</i>, or the dashing and
damnatory improvisation of Wilson in <i>Blackwood</i> or Jeffrey in
the <i>Edinburgh</i>. Still, allowance being made for the barbarous
partisanship of the established critical tribunals of the period,
it seems surprising that a social success so signal should have been
the consequence of a single article. The explanation is that the
writer of the article on Milton was, unlike most authors, also a
brilliant conversationalist. There has never been a period when
an amusing talker has not been in great demand at London
tables; but when Macaulay made his debut witty conversation
was studied and cultivated as it has ceased to be in the more
busy age which has succeeded. At the university Macaulay
had been recognized as pre-eminent for inexhaustible talk and
genial companionship among a circle of such brilliant young men
as Charles Austin, Romilly, Praed and Villiers. He now displayed
these gifts on a wider theatre. Launched on the best
that London had to give in the way of society, Macaulay accepted
and enjoyed with all the zest of youth and a vigorous nature the
opportunities opened for him. He was courted and admired by
the most distinguished personages of the day. He was admitted
at Holland House, where Lady Holland listened to him with
deference, and scolded him with a circumspection which was in
itself a compliment. Samuel Rogers spoke of him with friendliness
and to him with affection. He was treated with almost
fatherly kindness by &ldquo;Conversation&rdquo; Sharp.</p>

<p>Thus distinguished, and justifiably conscious of his great
powers, Macaulay began to aspire to a political career. But
the shadow of pecuniary trouble early began to fall upon his
path. When he went to college his father believed himself to
be worth £100,000. But commercial disaster overtook the house
of Babington &amp; Macaulay, and the son now saw himself compelled
to work for his livelihood. His Trinity fellowship of £300
a year became of great consequence to him, but it expired in
1831; he could make at most £200 a year by writing; and a
commissionership of bankruptcy, which was given him by Lord
Lyndhurst in 1828, and which brought him in about £400 a year,
was swept away, without compensation, by the ministry which
came into power in 1830. Macaulay was reduced to such straits
that he had to sell his Cambridge gold medal.</p>

<p>In February 1830 the doors of the House of Commons were
opened to him through what was then called a &ldquo;pocket borough.&rdquo;
Lord Lansdowne, who had been struck by two articles on James
Mill and the Utilitarians, which appeared in the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i> in 1829, offered the author the seat at Calne. The offer
was accompanied by the express assurance that the patron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>
had no wish to interfere with Macaulay&rsquo;s freedom of voting. He
thus entered parliament at one of the most exciting moments of
English domestic history, when the compact phalanx of reactionary
administration which for nearly fifty years had commanded
a crushing majority in the Commons was on the point
of being broken by the growing strength of the party of reform.
Macaulay made his maiden speech on the 5th of April 1830, on
the second reading of the Bill for the Removal of Jewish Disabilities.
In July the king died and parliament was dissolved; the
revolution took place in Paris. Macaulay, who was again
returned for Calne, visited Paris, eagerly enjoying a first taste
of foreign travel. On the 1st of March 1831 the Reform Bill
was introduced, and on the second night of the debate Macaulay
made the first of his reform speeches. It was, like all his speeches,
a success. Sir Robert Peel said of it that &ldquo;portions were as
beautiful as anything I have ever heard or read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Encouraged by this first success, Macaulay now threw himself
with ardour into the life of the House of Commons, while at the
same time he continued to enjoy to the full the social opportunities
which his literary and political celebrity had placed within
his reach. He dined out almost nightly, and spent many of his
Sundays at the suburban villas of the Whig leaders, while he
continued to supply the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> with articles. On the
triumph of Earl Grey&rsquo;s cabinet, and the passing of the Reform
Act in June 1832, Macaulay, whose eloquence had signalized
every stage of the conflict, became one of the commissioners of
the board of control, and applied himself to the study of Indian
affairs. Giving his days to India and his nights to the House of
Commons, he could only devote a few hours to literary composition
by rising at five when the business of the house had allowed
of his getting to bed in time on the previous evening. Between
September 1831 and December 1833 he furnished the <i>Review</i>
with eight important articles, besides writing his ballad on the
Armada.</p>

<p>In the first Reform Parliament, January 1833, Macaulay took
his seat as one of the two members for Leeds, which up to that
date had been unrepresented in the House of Commons. He
replied to O&rsquo;Connell in the debate on the address, meeting the
great agitator face to face, with high, but not intemperate,
defiance. In July he defended the Government of India Bill
in a speech of great power, and he was instrumental in getting
the bill through committee without unnecessary friction. When
the abolition of slavery came before the house as a practical
question, Macaulay had the prospect of having to surrender
office or to vote for a modified abolition, viz. twelve years&rsquo;
apprenticeship, which was proposed by the ministry, but condemned
by the abolitionists. He was prepared to make the
sacrifice of place rather than be unfaithful to the cause to which
his father had devoted his life. He placed his resignation in
Lord Althorp&rsquo;s hands, and spoke against the ministerial proposal.
But the sense of the house was so strongly expressed as unfavourable
that, finding they would be beaten if they persisted, the
ministry gave way, and reduced apprenticeship to seven years,
a compromise which the abolition party accepted; and Macaulay
remained at the board of control.</p>

<p>While he was thus growing in reputation, and advancing his
public credit, the fortunes of the family were sinking, and it
became evident that his sisters would have no provision except
such as their brother might be enabled to make for them.
Macaulay had but two sources of income, both of them precarious&mdash;office
and his pen. As to office, the Whigs could not have
expected at that time to retain power for a whole generation;
and, even while they did so, Macaulay&rsquo;s resolution that he would
always give an independent vote made it possible that he might
at any moment find himself in disagreement with his colleagues,
and have to quit his place. As to literature, he wrote to Lord
Lansdowne (1833), &ldquo;it has been hitherto merely my relaxation;
I have never considered it as the means of support. I have
chosen my own topics, taken my own time, and dictated my own
terms. The thought of becoming a bookseller&rsquo;s hack, of spurring
a jaded fancy to reluctant exertion, of filling sheets with trash
merely that sheets may be filled, of bearing from publishers
and editors what Dryden bore from Tonson and what Mackintosh
bore from Lardner, is horrible to me.&rdquo; Macaulay was thus
prepared to accept the offer of a seat in the supreme council of
India, created by the new India Act. The salary of the office
was fixed at £10,000, out of which he calculated to be able to
save £30,000 in five years. His sister Hannah accepted his
proposal to accompany him, and in February 1834 the brother
and sister sailed for Calcutta.</p>

<p>Macaulay&rsquo;s appointment to India occurred at the critical
moment when the government of the company was being
superseded by government by the Crown. His knowledge of
India was, when he landed, but superficial. But at this juncture
there was more need of statesmanship directed by general
liberal principles than of a practical knowledge of the details
of Indian administration. Macaulay&rsquo;s presence in the council
was of great value; his minutes are models of good judgment
and practical sagacity. The part he took in India has been
described as &ldquo;the application of sound liberal principles to a
government which had till then been jealous, close and repressive.&rdquo;
He vindicated the liberty of the press; he maintained the
equality of Europeans and natives before the law; and as president
of the committee of public instruction he inaugurated the
system of national education.</p>

<p>A clause in the India Act 1833 occasioned the appointment of
a commission to inquire into the jurisprudence of the Eastern
dependency. Macaulay was appointed president of that commission.
The draft of a penal code which he submitted became,
after a revision of many years, and by the labour of many
experienced lawyers, the Indian criminal code. Of this code
Sir James Stephen said that &ldquo;it reproduces in a concise and even
beautiful form the spirit of the law of England, in a compass
which by comparison with the original may be regarded as almost
absurdly small. The Indian penal code is to the English criminal
law what a manufactured article ready for use is to the materials
out of which it is made. It is to the French code pénal, and to
the German code of 1871, what a finished picture is to a sketch.
It is simpler and better expressed than Livingston&rsquo;s code for
Louisiana; and its practical success has been complete.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macaulay&rsquo;s enlightened views and measures drew down on
him, however, the abuse and ill-will of Anglo-Indian society.
Fortunately for himself he was enabled to maintain a tranquil
indifference to political detraction by withdrawing his thoughts
into a sphere remote from the opposition and enmity by which
he was surrounded. Even amid the excitement of his early
parliamentary successes literature had balanced politics in his
thoughts and interests. Now in his exile he began to feel more
strongly each year the attraction of European letters and European
history. He wrote to his friend Ellis: &ldquo;I have gone back
to Greek literature with a passion astonishing to myself. I have
never felt anything like it. I was enraptured with Italian
during the six months which I gave up to it; and I was little less
pleased with Spanish. But when I went back to the Greek I
felt as if I had never known before what intellectual enjoyment
was.&rdquo; In thirteen months he read through, some of them twice,
a large part of the Greek and Latin classics. The fascination
of these studies produced their inevitable effect upon his view
of political life. He began to wonder what strange infatuation
leads men who can do something better to squander their intellect,
their health and energy, on such subjects as those which most
statesmen are engaged in pursuing. He was already, he says,
&ldquo;more than half determined to abandon politics and give myself
wholly to letters, to undertake some great historical work, which
may be at once the business and the amusement of my life, and
to leave the pleasures of pestiferous rooms, sleepless nights, and
diseased stomachs to Roebuck and to Praed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1838 Macaulay and his sister Hannah, who had married
Charles Trevelyan in 1834, returned to England. He at once
entered parliament as member for Edinburgh. In 1839 he
became secretary at war, with a seat in the cabinet in Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s
ministry. His acceptance of office diverted him for a
time from prosecuting the plan he had already formed of a great
historical work. But in less than two years the Melbourne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span>
ministry fell. In 1842 appeared his <i>Lays of Ancient Rome</i>, and
in the next year he collected and published his <i>Essays</i>. He
returned to office in 1846, in Lord John Russell&rsquo;s administration,
as paymaster-general. His duties were very light, and the contact
with official life and the obligations of parliamentary attendance
were even of benefit to him while he was engaged upon
his <i>History</i>. In the sessions of 1846-1847 he spoke only five times,
and at the general election of July 1847 he lost his seat for Edinburgh.
The balance of Macaulay&rsquo;s faculties had now passed
to the side of literature. At an earlier date he had relished
crowds and the excitement of ever new faces; as years went
forward, and absorption in the work of composition took off the
edge of his spirits, he recoiled from publicity. He began to
regard the prospect of business as worry, and had no longer the
nerve to brace himself to the social efforts required of one who
represents a large constituency.</p>

<p>Macaulay retired into private life, not only without regret,
but with a sense of relief. He gradually withdrew from general
society, feeling the bore of big dinners and country-house visits,
but he still enjoyed close and constant intercourse with a circle
of the most eminent men that London then contained. At that
time social breakfasts were in vogue. Macaulay himself preferred
this to any other form of entertainment. Of these brilliant
reunions nothing has been preserved beyond the names of the
men who formed them&mdash;Rogers, Hallam, Sydney Smith, Lord
Carlisle, Lord Stanhope, Nassau Senior, Charles Greville, Milman,
Panizzi, G. C. Lewis, Van de Weyer. His biographer thus
describes Macaulay&rsquo;s appearance and bearing in conversation:
&ldquo;Sitting bolt upright, his hands resting on the arms of his chair,
or folded over the handle of his walking-stick, knitting his eyebrows
if the subject was one which had to be thought out as he
went along, or brightening from the forehead downwards when
a burst of humour was coming, his massive features and honest
glance suited well with the manly sagacious sentiments which he
set forth in his sonorous voice and in his racy and intelligible
language. To get at his meaning people had never the need to
think twice, and they certainly had seldom the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, great as was his enjoyment of literary society and books,
they only formed his recreation. In these years he was working
with unflagging industry at the composition of his <i>History</i>.
His composition was slow, his corrections both of matter and
style endless; he spared no pains to ascertain the facts. He
sacrificed to the prosecution of his task a political career, House
of Commons fame, the allurements of society. The first two
volumes of the <i>History of England</i> appeared in December 1848.
The success was in every way complete beyond expectation.
The sale of edition after edition, both in England and the United
States, was enormous.</p>

<p>In 1852, when his party returned to office, he refused a seat
in the cabinet, but he could not bring himself to decline the compliment
of a voluntary amende which the city of Edinburgh
paid him in returning him at the head of the poll at the general
election in July of that year. He had hardly accepted the
summons to return to parliamentary life before fatal weakness
betrayed itself in deranged action of the heart; from this time
forward till his death his strength continued steadily to sink.
The process carried with it dejection of spirits as its inevitable
attendant. The thought oppressed him that the great work
to which he had devoted himself would remain a fragment.
Once again, in June 1853, he spoke in parliament, and with
effect, against the exclusion of the master of the rolls from the
House of Commons, and at a later date in defence of competition
for the Indian civil service. But he was aware that it was a
grievous waste of his small stock of force, and that he made
these efforts at the cost of more valuable work.</p>

<p>In November 1855 vols. iii. and iv. of the <i>History</i> appeared
and obtained a vast circulation. Within a generation of its
first appearance upwards of 140,000 copies of the <i>History</i> were
printed and sold in the United Kingdom alone; and in the
United States the sales were on a correspondingly large scale.
The <i>History</i> was translated into German, Polish, Danish, Swedish,
Hungarian, Russian, Bohemian, Italian, French, Dutch and
Spanish. Flattering marks of respect were heaped upon the
author by foreign academies. His pecuniary profits were (for
that time) on a scale commensurate with the reputation of the
book: the cheque he received for £20,000 has become a landmark
in literary history.</p>

<p>In May 1856 he quitted the Albany, in which he had passed
fifteen happy years, and went to live at Holly Lodge, Campden
Hill, then, before it was enlarged, a tiny bachelor&rsquo;s dwelling,
but with a lawn whose unbroken slope of verdure gave it the air
of a considerable country house. In the following year (1857)
he was raised to the peerage by the title of Baron Macaulay
of Rothley. &ldquo;It was,&rdquo; says Lady Trevelyan, &ldquo;one of the few
things that everybody approved; he enjoyed it himself, as he did
everything, simply and cordially.&rdquo; It was a novelty in English
life to see eminence which was neither that of territorial opulence
nor of political or military services recognized and rewarded by
elevation to the peerage.</p>

<p>But Macaulay&rsquo;s health, which had begun to give way in 1852,
was every year visibly failing. In May 1858 he went to Cambridge
for the purpose of being sworn in as high steward of the
borough, to which office he had been elected on the death of Earl
Fitzwilliam. When his health was given at a public breakfast
in the town-hall he was obliged to excuse himself from speaking.
In the upper house he never spoke. Absorbed in the prosecution
of his historical work, he had grown indifferent to the party
politics of his own day. Gradually he had to acquiesce in the
conviction that, though his intellectual powers remained unimpaired,
his physical energies would not carry him through the
reign of Anne; and, though he brought down the narrative to the
death of William III., the last half-volume wants the finish and
completeness of the earlier portions. The winter of 1859 told
on him, and he died on the 28th of December. On the 9th of
January 1860 he was buried in Westminster Abbey, in Poets&rsquo;
Corner, near the statue of Addison.</p>

<p>Lord Macaulay never married. A man of warm domestic
affections, he found their satisfaction in the attachment and close
sympathy of his sister Hannah, the wife of Sir Charles Trevelyan.
Her children were to him as his own. Macaulay was a steadfast
friend, and no act inconsistent with the strictest honour and integrity
was ever imputed to him. When a poor man, and when
salary was of consequence to him, he twice resigned office rather
than make compliances for which he would not have been
severely blamed. In 1847, when his seat in parliament was at
stake, he would not be persuaded to humour, to temporize, even
to conciliate. He had a keen relish for the good things of life,
and desired fortune as the means of obtaining them; but there
was nothing mercenary or selfish in his nature. When he had
raised himself to opulence, he gave away with an open hand,
not seldom rashly. His very last act was to write a letter to a
poor curate enclosing a cheque for £25. The purity of his morals
was not associated with any tendency to cant.</p>

<p>The lives of men of letters are often records of sorrow or
suffering. The life of Macaulay was eminently happy. Till the
closing years (1857-1859), he enjoyed life with the full zest of
healthy faculty, happy in social intercourse, happy in the solitude
of his study, and equally divided between the two. For the
last fifteen years of his life he lived for literature. His writings
were remunerative to him far beyond the ordinary measure, yet
he never wrote for money. He lived in his historical researches;
his whole heart and interest were unreservedly given to the men
and the times of whom he read and wrote. His command of
literature was imperial. Beginning with a good classical
foundation, be made himself familiar with the imaginative, and
then with the historical, remains of Greece and Rome. He went
on to add the literature of his own country, of France, of Italy,
of Spain. He learnt Dutch enough for the purposes of his history.
He read German, but for the literature of the northern
nations he had no taste, and of the erudite labours of the
Germans he had little knowledge and formed an inadequate
estimate. The range of his survey of human things had other
limitations more considerable still. All philosophical speculation
was alien to his mind; nor did he seem aware of the degree in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>196</span>
which such speculation had influenced the progress of humanity.
A large&mdash;the largest&mdash;part of ecclesiastical history lay outside
his historical view. Of art he confessed himself ignorant, and
even refused a request to furnish a critique on Swift&rsquo;s poetry to
the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. Lessing&rsquo;s <i>Laocoon</i>, or Goethe&rsquo;s criticism
on Hamlet, &ldquo;filled&rdquo; him &ldquo;with wonder and despair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of the marvellous discoveries of science which were succeeding
each other day by day he took no note; his pages contain no
reference to them. It has been told already how he recoiled
from the mathematical studies of his university. These deductions
made, the circuit of his knowledge still remains very
wide&mdash;as extensive perhaps as any human brain is competent
to embrace. His literary outfit was as complete as has ever been
possessed by any English writer; and, if it wants the illumination
of philosophy, it has an equivalent resource in a practical
acquaintance with affairs, with administration, with the interior
of cabinets, and the humour of popular assemblies. Nor
was the knowledge merely stored in his memory; it was always
at his command. Whatever his subject, he pours over it his
stream of illustration, drawn from the records of all ages and
countries. His <i>Essays</i> are not merely instructive as history;
they are, like Milton&rsquo;s blank verse, freighted with the spoils of
all the ages. As an historian Macaulay has not escaped the
charge of partisanship. He was a Whig; and in writing the
history of the rise and triumph of Whig principles in the latter
half of the 17th century he identified himself with the cause.
But the charge of partiality, as urged against Macaulay, means
more than that he wrote the history of the Whig revolution from
the point of view of those who made it. When he is describing
the merits of friends and the faults of enemies his pen knows
no moderation. He has a constant tendency to glaring colours,
to strong effects, and will always be striking violent blows. He
is not merely exuberant but excessive. There is an overweening
confidence about his tone; he expresses himself in trenchant
phrases, which are like challenges to an opponent to stand
up and deny them. His propositions have no qualifications.
Uninstructed readers like this assurance, as they like a physician
who has no doubt about their case. But a sense of distrust grows
upon the more circumspect reader as he follows page after page
of Macaulay&rsquo;s categorical affirmations about matters which our
own experience of life teaches us to be of a contingent nature.
We inevitably think of a saying attributed to Lord Melbourne:
&ldquo;I wish I were as cocksure of any one thing as Macaulay is of
everything.&rdquo; Macaulay&rsquo;s was the mind of the advocate, not of
the philosopher; it was the mind of Bossuet, which admits no
doubts or reserves itself and tolerates none in others, and as such
was disqualified from that equitable balancing of evidence which
is the primary function of the historian.</p>

<p>Macaulay, the historian no less than the politician, is, however,
always on the side of justice, fairness for the weak against the
strong, the oppressed against the oppressor. But though a
Liberal in practical politics, he had not the reformer&rsquo;s temperament.
The world as it is was good enough for him. The glories
of wealth, rank, honours, literary fame, the elements of vulgar
happiness, made up his ideal of life. A successful man himself,
every personage and every cause is judged by its success. &ldquo;The
brilliant Macaulay,&rdquo; says Emerson, &ldquo;who expresses the tone of
the English governing classes of the day, explicitly teaches that
&lsquo;good&rsquo; means good to eat, good to wear, material commodity.&rdquo;
Macaulay is in accord with the average sentiment of orthodox
and stereotyped humanity on the relative values of the objects
and motives of human endeavour. And this commonplace
materialism is one of the secrets of his popularity, and one
of the qualities which guarantee that that popularity will be
enduring.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACAW,<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> or, as formerly spelt, <span class="sc">Maccaw</span>, the name given to
some fifteen or more species of large, long-tailed birds of the
parrot-family, natives of the neotropical region, and forming a
very well-known and easily recognized genus <i>Ara</i>, and to the
four species of Brazilian Hyacinthine macaws of the genera
<i>Anodorhynchus</i> and <i>Cyanopsittacus</i>. Most of the macaws are
remarkable for their gaudy plumage, which exhibits the brightest
scarlet, yellow, blue and green in varying proportion and often
in violent contrast, while a white visage often adds a very peculiar
and expressive character.<a name="fa1p" id="fa1p" href="#ft1p"><span class="sp">1</span></a> With one exception the known
species of <i>Ara</i> inhabit the mainland of America from Paraguay
to Mexico, being especially abundant in Bolivia, where no fewer
than seven of them (or nearly one half) have been found (<i>Proc.
Zool. Soc.</i>, 1879, p. 634). The single extra-continental species,
<i>A. tricolor,</i> is one of the most brilliantly coloured, and is peculiar
to Cuba, where, according to Gundlach (<i>Ornitologia Cubana</i>,
p. 126), its numbers are rapidly decreasing so that there is every
chance of its becoming extinct.<a name="fa2p" id="fa2p" href="#ft2p"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>Of the best known species of the group, the blue-and-yellow
macaw, <i>A. ararauna</i>, has an extensive range in South America
from Guiana in the east to Colombia in the west, and southwards
to Paraguay. Of large size, it is to be seen in almost every
zoological garden, and it is very frequently kept alive in
private houses, for its temper is pretty good, and it will become
strongly attached to those who tend it. Its richly coloured
plumage, sufficiently indicated by its common English name,
supplies feathers eagerly sought by salmon-fishers for the making
of artificial flies. The red-and-blue macaw, <i>A. macao</i>, is even
larger and more gorgeously clothed, for, besides the colours
expressed in its ordinary appellation, yellow and green enter into
its adornment. It inhabits Central as well as South America as
far as Bolivia, and is also a common bird in captivity, though
perhaps less often seen than the foregoing. The red-and-yellow
species, <i>A. chloroptera</i>, ranging from Panama to Brazil,
is smaller, or at least has a shorter tail, and is not quite so usually
met with in menageries. The red-and-green, <i>A. militaris</i>,
smaller again than the last, is not unfrequent in confinement,
and presents the colours of the name it bears. This has the
most northerly extension of habitat, occurring in Mexico and
thence southwards to Bolivia. In <i>A. manilata</i> and <i>A. nobilis</i>
the prevailing colour is green and blue. The Hyacinthine
macaws <i>A. hyacinthinus</i>, <i>A. leari</i>, <i>A. glaucus</i> and <i>Cyanopsittacus
spixi</i> are almost entirely blue.</p>

<p>The macaws live well in captivity, either chained to a perch
or kept in large aviaries in which their strong flight is noticeable.
The note of these birds is harsh and screaming. The sexes are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span>
alike; the lustreless white eggs are laid in hollow trees, usually
two at a time. The birds are gregarious but apparently
monogamous.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1p" id="ft1p" href="#fa1p"><span class="fn">1</span></a> This serves to separate the macaws from the long-tailed parakeets
of the New World (<i>Conurus</i>), to which they are very nearly
allied.</p>

<p><a name="ft2p" id="ft2p" href="#fa2p"><span class="fn">2</span></a> There is some reason to think that Jamaica may have formerly
possessed a macaw (though no example is known to exist), and if so
it was most likely a peculiar species. Sloane (<i>Voyage</i>, ii. 297),
after describing what he calls the &ldquo;great maccaw&rdquo; (<i>A. ararauna</i>),
which he had seen in captivity in that island, mentions the &ldquo;small
maccaw&rdquo; as being very common in the woods there, and P. H.
Gosse (<i>Birds of Jamaica</i>, p. 260) gives, on the authority of Robinson,
a local naturalist of the last century, the description of a bird
which cannot be reconciled with any species now known, though it
must have evidently been allied to the Cuban <i>A. tricolor</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACBETH,<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> king of Scotland (d. 1058), was the son of Findlaech,
<i>mormaer</i> or hereditary ruler of Moreb (Moray and Ross),
who had been murdered by his nephews in 1020. He probably
became mormaer on the death of Malcolm, one of the murderers,
in 1029, and he may have been one of the chiefs (the Maclbaethe
of the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i>) who submitted to Canute in 1031.
Marianus records that in 1040 Duncan, the grandson and successor
of Malcolm king of Scotland, was slain by Macbeth. Duncan
had shortly before suffered a severe defeat at the hands of
Thorfinn, the Norwegian earl of Orkney and Caithness, and it was
perhaps this event which tempted Macbeth to seize the throne.
As far as is known he had no claim to the crown except through
his wife Gruach, who appears to have been a member of the
royal family. Macbeth was apparently a generous benefactor
to the Church, and is said to have made a pilgrimage to Rome in
1050. According to S. Berchan his reign was a time of prosperity
for Scotland. The records of the period, however, are
extremely meagre, and much obscurity prevails, especially as
to his relations with the powerful earl Thorfinn. More than one
attempt was made by members of the Scottish royal family
to recover the throne; in 1045 by Crinan, the lay abbot of
Dunkeld, son-in-law of Malcolm II., and in 1054 by Duncan&rsquo;s
son Malcolm with the assistance of Siward the powerful earl of
Northumbria, himself a connexion of the ousted dynasty. Three
years later in 1057 Malcolm and Siward again invaded Scotland
and the campaign ended with the defeat and death of Macbeth,
who was slain at Lumphanan. Macbeth is, of course, chiefly
famous as the central figure of Shakespeare&rsquo;s great tragedy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACCABEES,<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span> the name (in the plural) of a distinguished
Jewish family dominant in Jerusalem in the 2nd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
According to 1 Macc. ii. 4, the name Maccabaeus (Gr. <span class="grk" title="Makkabaios">&#924;&#945;&#954;&#954;&#945;&#946;&#8150;&#959;&#962;</span>-?
Heb. <span title="makabi">&#1502;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497;</span>) was originally the distinctive surname of
Judas, third son of the Jewish priest Mattathias, who struck
the first blow for religious liberty during the persecution
under Antiochus IV. (Epiphanes). Subsequently, however, it
obtained a wider significance, having been applied first to
the kinsmen of Judas, then to his adherents, and ultimately
to all champions of religion in the Greek period. Thus
the mother of the seven brethren, whose martyrdom is
related in 2 Macc. vi., vii., is called by early Christian writers
&ldquo;the mother of the Maccabees.&rdquo; The name is used still more
loosely in the titles of the so-called Third, Fourth and Fifth
Books of Maccabees. It is now customary to apply it only
to the sons and descendants of Mattathias. As, however,
according to Josephus (<i>Ant.</i> xii. 6. 1), this brave priest&rsquo;s great-great-grandfather
was called <i>&#7716;asmon</i> (<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;rich&rdquo; = magnate;
cf. Ps. lxviii. 31 [32]), the family is more correctly designated
by the name of Hasmonaeans or Asmoneans (<i>q.v.</i>). This name
Jewish authors naturally prefer to that of Maccabees; they
also style 1 and 2 Macc. &ldquo;Books of the Hasmonaeans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Maccabee (<i>maqq&#257;bi</i>) is the original form of the name,
the most probable derivation is from the Aramaic <i>maqq&#257;b&#257;</i>
(Heb. <span title="makevet">&#1502;&#1511;&#1489;&#1514;</span>, Judg. iv. 21, &amp;c.) = &ldquo;hammer.&rdquo; The surname
&ldquo;hammerer&rdquo; might have been applied to Judas either as a
distinctive title pure and simple or symbolically as in the
parallel case of Edward I., &ldquo;Scotorum <i>malleus</i>.&rdquo; Even if
<i>m&#257;qq&#257;ba</i> does denote the ordinary workman&rsquo;s hammer, and not
the great smith&rsquo;s hammer which would more fitly symbolize the
impetuosity of Judas, this is not a fatal objection. The doubled
<i>k</i> of the Greek form is decisive against (1) the theory that the
name Maccabee was made up of the initials of the opening
words of Exod. xv. ii; (2) the derivation from <span title="machvi">&#1502;&#1499;&#1489;&#1497;</span> = &ldquo;extinguisher&rdquo;
(cf. Isa. xliii. 17), based by Curtiss (<i>The Name
Machabee</i>, Leipzig, 1876) on the Latin spelling Machabaeus =
<span class="grk" title="Makkabaios">&#924;&#945;&#954;&#954;&#945;&#946;&#8150;&#959;&#962;</span>, which Jerome probably adopted in accordance
with the usage of the times.</p>

<p>The Maccabaean revolt was caused by the attempt of
Antiochus IV. (Epiphanes), king of Syria (175-164 B. C.), to force
Hellenism upon Judaea (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Seleucid Dynasty</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hellenism</a></span>).
Ever since the campaigns of Alexander the Great, Greek habits
and ideas had been widely adopted in Palestine. Over the
higher classes especially Hellenism had cast its spell. This called
forth the organized opposition of the &#7716;as&#299;d&#299;m (= &ldquo;the pious&rdquo;),
who constituted themselves champions of the Law. Joshua,
who headed the Hellenistic faction, graecized his name into
Jason, contrived to have the high-priesthood taken from his
brother Onias III., and conferred upon himself, and set up a
gymnasium hard by the Temple. After three years&rsquo; tenure of
office Jason was supplanted by the Benjamite Menelaus, who
disowned Judaism entirely. Antiochus punished an outburst
of strife between the rivals by plundering the Temple and
slaying many of the inhabitants (170 B. C.). Two years later
Jerusalem was devastated by his general Apollonius, and a
Syrian garrison occupied the citadel (Akra). The Jews were
ordered under pain of death to substitute for their own observances
the Pagan rites prescribed for the empire generally.
In December 168 sacrifice was offered to Zeus upon an idol
altar (&ldquo;the abomination of desolation,&rdquo; Dan. x. 27) erected
over the great altar of burnt-offering. But Antiochus had
miscalculated, and by his extreme measures unwittingly saved
Judaism from its internal foes. Many hellenizers rallied round
those who were minded to die rather than abjure their religion.
The issue of an important edict ordaining the erection of heathen
altars in every township of Palestine, and the appointment
of officers to deal with recusants, brought matters to a crisis.
At Modin, Mattathias, an aged priest, not only refused to offer
the first sacrifice, but slew an apostate Jew who was about
to step into the breach. He also killed the king&rsquo;s commissioner
and pulled down the altar. Having thus given the signal
for rebellion, he then with his five sons took to the mountains.
In view of the ruthless slaughter of a thousand sabbatarians
in the wilderness, Mattathias and his friends decided to resist
attack even on the sabbath. Many, including the &#7716;as&#299;d&#299;m,
thereupon flocked to his standard, and set themselves to revive
Jewish rites and to uproot Paganism from the land. In 166
Mattathias died, after charging his sons to give their lives
for their ancestral faith, and nominating Judas Maccabaeus
as their leader in the holy campaign.</p>

<p>The military genius of Judas made this the most stirring
chapter in Israelitish history. In quick succession he overthrew
the Syrian generals Apollonius, Seron and Gorgias,
and after the regent Lysias had shared the same fate at his
hands he restored the Temple worship (165). These exploits
dismayed his opponents and kindled the enthusiasm of his
friends. When, however, Lysias returned in force to renew
the contest, Judas had to fall back upon the Temple mount,
and escaped defeat only because the Syrian leader was obliged
to hasten back to Antioch in order to prevent a rival from
seizing the regency. Under these circumstances Lysias unexpectedly
guaranteed to the Jews their religious freedom
(162). But though they had thus gained their end, the struggle
did not cease; it merely assumed a new phase. The &#7716;as&#299;d&#299;m
indeed were satisfied, and declined to fight longer, but the
Maccabees determined not to desist until their nation was
politically as well as religiously free. In 161 Judas defeated
Nicanor at Adasa, but within a few weeks thereafter, in a
heroic struggle against superior numbers under Bacchides
at Elasa, he was himself cut off. Even this, however, did not
prove fatal to the cause which Judas had espoused. If in his
brother Jonathan it did not possess so brilliant a soldier, it
had in him an astute diplomatist who knew how to exploit the
internal troubles of Syria. In the contest between Demetrius I.
and Alexander Balas for the throne, Jonathan supported the
latter, who in 153 nominated him high priest, and conferred
on him the order of &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Friend,&rdquo; besides other honours.
After the accession of Demetrius II. (145) Jonathan contrived
to win his favour, and helped him to crush a rebellion in Antioch
on condition that the Syrian garrisons should be withdrawn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span>
from Judaea. When, however, Demetrius failed to keep his
word, Jonathan transferred his allegiance to Antiochus VI., whom
Tryphon had crowned as king. After subjugating the territory
between Jerusalem and Damascus, he routed the generals
of Demetrius on the plain of Hazor. But as the Maccabees
had now in the name of the Syrians cleared the Syrians
out of Palestine, Tryphon&rsquo;s jealousy was aroused, and he
resolved to be rid of Jonathan, who, with all his cunning,
walked into a trap at Ptolemais, was made prisoner and ultimately
slain (143). The leadership now devolved upon Simon,
the last survivor of the sons of Mattathias. He soon got the
better of Tryphon, who vainly tried to reach Jerusalem. Allying
himself to Demetrius, Simon succeeded in negotiating a
treaty whereby the political independence of Judaea was at
length secured. The garrison in the Akra having been starved
into submission, Simon triumphantly entered that fortress
in May 142. In the following year he was by popular decree
invested with absolute powers, being appointed leader, high
priest and ethnarch. As these offices were declared hereditary
in his family, he became the founder of the Hasmonaean dynasty.
The first year of his reign (Seleucid year 170 = 143-142 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>)
was made the beginning of a new era, and the issue of a Jewish
coinage betokened the independence of his sovereignty. Under
Simon&rsquo;s administration the country enjoyed signal prosperity.
Its internal resources were assiduously developed; trade,
agriculture, civic justice and religion were fostered; while at
no epoch in its post-exilic history did Israel enjoy an equal
measure of social happiness (I Macc. xiv. 4 seq.). Simon&rsquo;s
beneficent activities came, however, to a sudden and tragic
end. In 135 he and two of his sons were murdered by Ptolemy,
his son-in-law, who had an eye to the supreme power. But
Simon&rsquo;s third son, John Hyrcanus, warned in time, succeeded
in asserting his rights as hereditary head of the state. All
the sons of Mattathias had now died for the sake of &ldquo;The
Law&rdquo;; and the result of their work, so valorously prosecuted
for over thirty years, was a new-born enthusiasm in Israel
for the ancestral faith. The Maccabaean struggle thus gave
fresh life to the Jewish nation.</p>

<p>After the death of Antiochus VII. Sidetes in 128 left him a
free hand, Hyrcanus (135-105) soon carved out for himself
a large and prosperous kingdom, which, however, was rent
by internal discord owing to the antagonism developed between
the rival parties of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Hyrcanus
was succeeded by his son Aristobulus, whose reign of but one
year was followed by that of his brother, the warlike Alexander
Jannaeus (104-78). The new king&rsquo;s Sadducean proclivities
rendered him odious to the populace, which rose in
revolt, but only to bring upon itself a savage revenge. The
accession of his widow Salome Alexandra (78-69) witnessed
a complete reversal of the policy pursued by Jannaeus, for she
chose to rule in accordance with the ideals of the Pharisees.
Her elder son, Hyrcanus II., a pliable weakling, was appointed
high priest; her younger son, the energetic Aristobulus, who
chafed at his exclusion from office, seized some twenty strongholds
and with an army bore down upon Jerusalem. At this
crisis Alexandra died, and Hyrcanus agreed to retire in favour
of his masterful brother. A new and disturbing element now
entered into Jewish politics in the person of the Idumaean
Antipater, who for selfish ends deliberately made mischief
between the brothers. An appeal to M. Aemilius Scaurus,
who in 65 came into Syria as the legate of Pompey, led to the
interference of the Romans, the siege of Jerusalem by Pompey,
and the vassalage of the Jews (<i>q.v.</i>). Hyrcanus II. was appointed
high priest and ethnarch, without the title of king (63). Repeated
but fruitless attempts were made by the Hasmonaeans
and their patriotic supporters to throw off the Roman yoke.
In 47 Antipater, who curried favour with Rome, was made
procurator of Judaea, and his sons Phasael and Herod governors
of Jerusalem and Galilee respectively. Six years later the
Idumaean brothers were appointed tetrarchs of Judaea. At
length, in 40, the Parthians set up as king Antigonus, sole
surviving son of Aristobulus. Thereupon Phasael committed
suicide in prison, but Herod effected his escape and with the
help of the Romans seated himself on the throne of Judaea
(37 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). Through the execution of Antigonus by M. Antonius
(Mark Antony) the same year the Hasmonaean dynasty became
extinct.</p>

extant. Book iii. is included in the Septuagint but not in the
Vulgate. Book iv. is embraced in the Alexandrian, Sinaitic,
and other MSS. of the Septuagint, as well as in some MSS. of
Josephus. A &ldquo;Fifth&rdquo; book is contained in the Ambrosian
Peshitta, but it seems to be merely a Syriac reproduction of
the sixth book of Josephus&rsquo;s history of the <i>Jewish War</i>. None
of the books of Maccabees are contained in the Vatican (B);
all of them are found in a Syriac recension.</p>

<p><i>1 Maccabees</i> was originally written in Hebrew, but is preserved
only in a Greek translation. Origen gives a transliteration
of &ldquo;its Semitic title,&rdquo;<a name="fa1q" id="fa1q" href="#ft1q"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and Jerome says distinctly:
&ldquo;The First Book of Maccabees I found in Hebrew.&rdquo; The
frequent Hebraisms which mark the Greek translation, as well
as the fact that some obscure passages in the Greek text are
best accounted for as mistranslations from the Hebrew, afford
internal evidence of the truth of this testimony. There are
good reasons for regarding the book as a unity, although some
scholars (Destinon, followed by Wellhausen) consider the
concluding chapters (xiii.-xvi.) a later addition unknown to
Josephus, who, however, seems to have already used the Greek.
It probably dates from about the beginning of the first century
<span class="scs">B.C.</span><a name="fa2q" id="fa2q" href="#ft2q"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>As it supplies a detailed and accurate record of the forty
years from the accession of Antiochus Epiphanes to the death
of Simon (175-135 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), without doubt the most stirring
chapter in Jewish history, the book is one of the most precious
historical sources we possess. In its careful chronology, based
upon the Seleucid era, in the minuteness of its geographical
knowledge, in the frankness with which it records defeat as
well as victory, on the restraint with which it speaks of the
enemies of the Jews, in its command of details, it bears on
its face the stamp of genuineness. Not that it is wholly free
from error or exaggeration, but its mistakes are due merely to
defective knowledge of the outside world, and its overstatements,
virtually confined to the matter of numbers, proceed
from a patriotic desire to magnify Jewish victories. While
the author presumably had some written sources at his disposal,<a name="fa3q" id="fa3q" href="#ft3q"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
his narrative is probably for the most part founded upon
personal knowledge and recollection of the events recorded,
and upon such first-hand information as, living in the second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>199</span>
generation after, he would still be in a position to obtain. His
sole aim is honestly to relate what he knew of the glorious
struggles of his nation.</p>

<p>Although written in the style of the historical books of the
old Testament, the work is characterized by a religious reticence
which avoids even the use of the divine name, and by the
virtual absence of the Messianic hope. The observance of the
law is strongly urged, and the cessation of prophecy deplored
(iv. 46; xiv. 41). There is no allusion either to the immortality
of the soul or to the resurrection of the dead. The rewards
to which the dying Mattathias points his sons are all for this
life. Many scholars are of opinion that the unknown author
was a Sadducee,<a name="fa4q" id="fa4q" href="#ft4q"><span class="sp">4</span></a> but all that can be said with certainty is
that he was a Palestinian Jew devotedly attached to the national
cause.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Until the council of Trent 1 Maccabees had only &ldquo;ecclesiastical&rdquo;
rank, and although not accepted as canonical by the Protestant
churches, it has always been held in high estimation. Luther says
&ldquo;it closely resembles the rest of the books of Holy Scripture, and
would not be unworthy to be enumerated with them.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><i>2 Maccabees</i>, the epitome of a larger work in five books by
one Jason of Cyrene, deals with the same history as its predecessor,
except that it begins at a point one year earlier (176
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and stops short at the death of Nicanor (161 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), thus
covering a period of only fifteen years. First of all<a name="fa5q" id="fa5q" href="#ft5q"><span class="sp">5</span></a> the writer
describes the futile attempt of Heliodorus to rob the Temple,
and the malicious intrigues of the Benjamite Simon against
the worthy high priest Onias III. (iii. i-iv. 6). As throwing
light upon the situation prior to the Maccabaean revolt this
section of the book is of especial value. Chapters iv. 7-vii. 42
contain a more detailed narrative of the events recorded in
1 Macc. i. 10-64. The remainder of the book runs parallel
to 1 Macc, iii.-vii.</p>

<p>Originally written in excellent Greek, from a pronouncedly
Pharisaic standpoint, it was possibly directed against the
Hasmonaean dynasty. It shows no sympathy with the priestly
class. Both in trustworthiness and in style it is inferior to
1 Macc. Besides being highly coloured, the narrative does not
observe strict chronological sequence. Instead of the sober
annalistic style of the earlier historian we have a work marked
by hyperbole, inflated rhetoric and homiletic reflection. Bitter
invective is heaped upon the national enemies, and strong
predilection is shown for the marvellous. The fullness and
inaccuracy of detail which are a feature of the book suggest
that Jason&rsquo;s information was derived from the recollections
of eye-witnesses orally communicated. In spite of its obvious
defects, however, it forms a useful supplement to the first
book.</p>

<p>The writer&rsquo;s interests are religious rather than historical.
In 1 Macc, there is a keen sense of the part to be played
by the Jews themselves, of the necessity of employing their
own skill and valour; here they are made to rely rather upon
divine intervention. Fantastic apparitions of angelic and
supernatural beings, gorgeously arrayed and mostly upon
horseback, are frequently introduced. In general, the views
reflected in the book are those of the Pharisees. The ungodly
will be punished mercilessly, and in exact correspondence to
their sins.<a name="fa6q" id="fa6q" href="#ft6q"><span class="sp">6</span></a> The chastisements of erring Jews are of short
duration, and intended to recall them to duty. If the faithful
suffer martyrdom, it is in order to serve as an example to others,
and they shall be compensated by being raised up &ldquo;unto an
eternal renewal of life.&rdquo; The eschatology of 2 Macc. is singularly
advanced, for it combines the doctrine of a resurrection
with that of immortality. It is worthy of note that the
Roman Church finds support in this book for its teaching with
reference to prayers for the dead and purgatory (xii. 43 seq.).
An allusion to Jeremiah as &ldquo;he who prayeth much for the
people and the holy city&rdquo; (xv. 14) it likewise appeals to as
favouring its views respecting the intercession of the saints.</p>

<p>Neither of Jason&rsquo;s work, nor of the epitomizer&rsquo;s, can the
precise date be determined. The changed relations with Rome
(viii. 10, 36) prove, however, that the latter was written later
than 1 Macc.; and it is equally clear that it was composed
before the destruction of Jerusalem, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The account given of the martyrs in chs. vi. and vii. led to frequent
allusions to this book in early patristic literature. Only Augustine,
however, was minded to give it the canonical rank to which it has
been raised by the Roman Church. Luther judged of it as unfavourably
as he judged of 1 Macc, favourably, and even &ldquo;wished it had
never existed.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><i>3 Maccabees</i>, although purporting to be an historical narrative,
is really an animated, if somewhat vapid, piece of fiction
written in Greek somewhere between 100 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> and <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70,<a name="fa7q" id="fa7q" href="#ft7q"><span class="sp">7</span></a> and
apparently preserved only in part.<a name="fa8q" id="fa8q" href="#ft8q"><span class="sp">8</span></a> It has no connexion with
the Hasmonaeans, but is a story of the deliverance experienced
by the Egyptian Jews from impending martyrdom at the hand
of Ptolemy IV. Philopator, who reigned in the century previous
to the Maccabaean rising (222-205 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). The title is of later
origin, and rendered possible only by the generalization of the
name Maccabee so as to embrace all who suffered for the ancestral
faith. Josephus refers the legend on which it is based to
the time of Ptolemy VII. Physcon (146-117 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). Some scholars
(Ewald, Reuss, Hausrath) think that what the story really
points to is the persecution under Caligula, but in that case
Ptolemy would naturally have been represented as claiming
divine honours. No other source informs us of a visit to Jerusalem,
or of a persecution of the Jews, on the part of Philopator.
Possibly, however, the story may be founded on some historical
situation regarding which we have no definite knowledge. The
purpose of the writer was evidently to cheer his Egyptian
brethren during some persecution at Alexandria. Although
the book was favourably regarded in the Syrian, it was apparently
unknown to the Latin Church. Among the Jews it was
virtually ignored.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Briefly, the tale is as follows:&mdash;After the battle of Raphia<a name="fa9q" id="fa9q" href="#ft9q"><span class="sp">9</span></a> (217
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Ptolemy IV. Philopator insisted on entering the sanctuary
at Jerusalem, but was struck down by the Almighty in answer to the
prayers of the horrified Jews. On his return to Egypt he revenged
himself by curtailing the religious liberty of the Alexandrian Jews,
and by depriving of their civic rights all who refused to worship
Bacchus. Exasperated by their loyalty to their religion, the king
ordered all the Jews in Egypt to be imprisoned in the hippodrome
of Alexandria. Clerks were told off to prepare a list of the prisoners&rsquo;
names, but after forty days constant toil they had exhausted their
writing materials without finishing their task. Ptolemy further
commanded that 500 elephants should be intoxicated and let loose
upon the occupants of the race-course. Only an accident prevented
the carrying out of this design; the king had slept until it was past
the time for his principal meal. On the following day, in virtue of
a divinely induced forgetfulness, Ptolemy recollected nothing but
the loyalty of the Jews to his throne. The same evening, nevertheless,
he repeated his order for their destruction. Accordingly, on
the morning of the third day, when the king attended to see his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>200</span>
commands executed, things had reached a crisis. The Jews prayed
to the Lord for mercy, and two angels appeared from heaven, to the
confusion of the royal troops, who were trampled down by the elephants.
Ptolemy now vented his wrath upon his counsellors,
liberated the Jews, and feasted them for seven days. They determined
that these should be kept as festal days henceforth in commemoration
of their deliverance. The provincial governors were
enjoined to take the Jews under their protection, and leave was given
to the latter to slay those of their kinsmen who had deserted the
faith. They further celebrated their deliverance at Ptolemais,
where they built a synagogue, and they reached their various abodes
to find themselves not only reinstated in their possessions, but raised
in the esteem of the Egyptians.</p>
</div>

<p><i>4 Maccabees</i> differs essentially from the other books of this
name. While it does not itself aim at being a history, it makes
striking use of Jewish history for purposes of edification. It
bears, moreover, a distinctly philosophical character, and takes
the form of a &ldquo;tractate&rdquo; or discourse, addressed to Jews only,<a name="fa10q" id="fa10q" href="#ft10q"><span class="sp">10</span></a>
upon &ldquo;the supremacy of pious reason over the passions.&rdquo; <a name="fa11q" id="fa11q" href="#ft11q"><span class="sp">11</span></a> The
material is well arranged and systematically handled. In the
prologue (i. 1-12) the writer explains the aim and scope of his
work. Then follows the first main division (i. 13-iii. 18), in
which he treats philosophically the proposition that reason is
the mistress of the passions, inquiring what is meant by &ldquo;reason&rdquo;
and what by &ldquo;passion,&rdquo; as well as how many kinds of passion
there are, and whether reason rules them all. The conclusion
reached is that with the exception of forgetfulness and ignorance
all the affections are under the lordship of reason, or at all events
of <i>pious</i> reason. To follow the dictates of pious reason in opposition
to natural inclination is to have learned the secret of
victory over the passions. In the second part of the book
(iii. 19-xviii. 5) the writer goes on to prove his thesis from Jewish
history, dwelling in particular upon the noble stand made against
the tyranny of Antiochus IV. Epiphanes by the priest Eleazar,
the seven brothers and their mother&mdash;all of whom chose torture
and death rather than apostatize from the faith. Finally he
appeals to his readers to emulate these acts of piety (xvii. 7-xviii.
24). In his gruesome descriptions of physical sufferings the
author offends against good taste even more than the writer of
2 Macc., while both contrast very unfavourably in this respect
with the sober reserve of the gospel narratives.</p>

<p>The book is written in a cultured, if somewhat rhetorical,
Greek style, and is unmistakably coloured by the Stoic philosophy.
The four cardinal virtues are represented as forms of wisdom,
which again is inseparable from the Mosaic law. That the writer
owes no slavish adherence to any philosophical system is plain
from his independent treatment of the affections. Although
influenced by Hellenism, he is a loyal Jew, earnestly desirous
that all who profess the same faith should adhere to it in spite
of either Greek allurements or barbaric persecution. It is not to
reason as such, but only to pious reason (<i>i.e.</i> to reason enlightened
and controlled by the divine law), that he attributes lordship over
the passions. While in his zeal for legalism he virtually adopts
the standpoint of Pharisaism, he is at one with Jewish Hellenism
in substituting belief in the soul&rsquo;s immortality for the doctrine
of a bodily resurrection.</p>

<p>The name of the author is unknown. He was, however,
clearly a Hellenistic Jew, probably resident in Alexandria or
Asia Minor. In the early Church the work was commonly
ascribed to Josephus and incorporated with his writings. But
apart from the fact that it is found also in several MSS. of the
Septuagint, the language and style of the book are incompatible
with his authorship. So also is the circumstance that 2 Macc.,
which forms the basis of 4 Macc., was unknown to Josephus.
Moreover, several unhistorical statements (such as, <i>e.g.</i> that
Seleucus was succeeded by his <i>son</i> Antiochus Epiphanes, iv. 15)
militate against the view that Josephus was the author. The
date of composition cannot be definitely fixed. It is, however,
safe to say that the book must have been written later than
2 Macc., and (in view of the acceptance it met with in the
Christian Church) prior to the destruction of Jerusalem. Most
likely it is a product of the Herodian period.</p>

<p><i>5 Maccabees.</i> Writing in 1566 Sixtus Senensis mentions
having seen at Lyons a manuscript of a so-called &ldquo;Fifth Book
of Maccabees&rdquo; in the library of Santas Pagninus, which was soon
afterwards destroyed by fire. It began with the words: &ldquo;After
the murder of Simon, John his son became high priest in his
stead.&rdquo; Sixtus conjectures that it may have been a Greek
translation of the &ldquo;chronicles&rdquo; of John Hyrcanus, alluded to
in 1 Macc., xvi. 24. He acknowledges that it is a history of
Hyrcanus practically on the lines of Josephus, but concludes
from its Hebraistic style that it was not from that writer&rsquo;s pen.
The probability, however, is that it was &ldquo;simply a reproduction
of Josephus, the style being changed perhaps for a purpose&rdquo;
(Schürer).</p>

<p>The Arabic &ldquo;Book of Maccabees&rdquo; contained in the Paris and
London Polyglotts, and purporting to be a history of the Jews
from the affair of Heliodorus (186 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) to the close of Herod&rsquo;s
reign, is historically worthless, being nothing but a compilation
from 1 and 2 Macc. and Josephus. In the one chapter (xii.)
where the writer ventures to detach himself from these works
he commits glaring historical blunders. The book was written
in somewhat Hebraistic Greek subsequent to <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70. In
Cotton&rsquo;s English translation of <i>The Five Books of Maccabees</i> it
is this book that is reckoned the &ldquo;Fifth.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The best modern editions of the Greek text of the four books of
Maccabees are those of O. F. Fritzsche (1871) and H. B. Swete
(Cambridge Septuagint, vol. iii., 1894). C. J. Ball&rsquo;s <i>The Variorum
Apocrypha</i> will be found specially useful by those who cannot conveniently
consult the Greek. The best modern commentary is that
of C. L. W. Grimm (1853-1857). C. F. Keil&rsquo;s commentary on 1 and 2
Macc. is very largely indebted to Grimm. More recently there have
appeared commentaries by E. C. Bissell on 1, 2 and 3 Macc. in Lange-Schaff&rsquo;s
commentary, 1880&mdash;the whole Apocrypha being embraced
in one volume, and much of the material being transferred from
Grimm; G. Rawlinson on 1 and 2 Macc. in the <i>Speaker&rsquo;s Commentary</i>
1888 (containing much useful matter, but marred by too frequent
inaccuracy); O. Zöckler, on 1, 2 and 3 Macc., 1891 (slight and unsatisfactory);
W. Fairweather and J. S. Black on 1 Macc. in the <i>Cambridge
Bible for Schools</i> (1897); E. Kautzsch on 1 and 3 Macc., A.
Kamphausen on 2 Macc. and A. Deissmann on 4 Macc. in <i>Die
Apok. u. Pseudepigr. des Alt. Test.</i>, 1898 (a most serviceable work for
the student of apocryphal literature). Brief but useful introductions
to all the four books of Maccabees are given in E. Schürer&rsquo;s <i>Geschichte
des Jüdischen Volkes im Zeitalter Jesu Christi</i> (3rd ed., 1898-1901;
Eng. tr. of earlier edition, 1886-1890).</p>

the first century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> forms the superior limit; and as the book found

said in the previous section of the book, point to the loss of at least
an introductory chapter.</p>

<p><a name="ft9q" id="ft9q" href="#fa9q"><span class="fn">9</span></a> The statements with reference to the war between Antiochus
the Great and Ptolemy Philopator are in general agreement with
those of the classical historians, and to this extent the tale may be
said to have an historical setting. By Grimm (<i>Einl.</i> § 3), the observance
of the two yearly festivals (vi. 26; vii. 19), and the existence
of the synagogue at Ptolemais when the book was written, are viewed
as the witness of tradition to the fact of some great deliverance.
Fritzsche has well pointed out, however (art. &ldquo;Makkabäer&rdquo; in
Schenkel&rsquo;s <i>Bibel-Lexicon</i>) that in the hands of Jewish writers of the
period nearly every event of consequence has a festival attached
to it.</p>

<p><a name="ft10q" id="ft10q" href="#fa10q"><span class="fn">10</span></a> Even if with Freudenthal we regard the work as a homily actually
delivered to a Jewish congregation&mdash;and there are difficulties in the
way of this theory, particularly the absence of a Biblical text&mdash;it
was clearly intended for publication. It is essentially a book in the
form of a discourse, whether it was ever orally delivered or not. So

He was chairman of the Anti-Parnellites from the fall of C. S.
Parnell in 1890 until January 1896; but his Nationalism was of
a temperate and orderly kind, and though his personal distinction
singled him out for the chairmanship during the party
dissensions of this period, he was in no active sense the political
leader. His real bent was towards literature. His earliest
publications were novels, some of which, such as <i>A Fair Saxon</i>
(1873), <i>Dear Lady Disdain</i> (1875), <i>Miss Misanthrope</i> (1878),
<i>Donna Quixote</i> (1879), attained considerable popularity. His
most important work is his <i>History of Our Own Times</i> (vols. i.-iv.,
1879-1880; vol. v., 1897), which treats of the period between Queen
Victoria&rsquo;s accession and her diamond jubilee. Easily and delightfully
written, and on the whole eminently sane and moderate,
these volumes form a brilliant piece of narrative from a Liberal
standpoint. He also began a <i>History of the Four Georges</i> (1884-1901),
of which the latter half was written by his son, Justin
Huntly M&lsquo;Carthy (b. 1860), himself the author of various
clever novels, plays, poetical pieces and short histories. Justin
M&lsquo;Carthy, amongst other works, wrote biographies of Sir Robert
Peel (1891), Pope Leo XIII. (1896) and W. E. Gladstone (1898);
<i>Modern England</i> (1898); <i>The Reign of Queen Anne</i> (1902) and
<i>Reminiscences</i> (2 vols., 1899).</p>

<p><span class="bold">McCHEYNE, ROBERT MURRAY<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> (1813-1843), Scottish
divine, was born at Edinburgh on the 21st of May 1813, was
educated at the University and at the Divinity Hall of his native
city, and held pastorates at Larbert, near Falkirk, and Dundee.
A mission of inquiry among the Jews throughout Europe and in
Palestine, and a religious revival at his church in Dundee, made
him feel that he was being called to evangelistic rather than to
pastoral work, but before he could carry out his plans he died,
on the 25th of March 1843. McCheyne, though wielding remarkable
influence in his lifetime, was still more powerful afterwards,
through his <i>Memoirs and Remains</i>, edited by Andrew Bonar,
which ran into far over a hundred English editions. Some of his
hymns, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;When this passing world is done,&rdquo; are well known.</p>

<p><span class="bold">McCLELLAN, GEORGE BRINTON<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> (1826-1885), American
soldier, was born in Philadelphia on the 3rd of December 1826.
After passing two years (1840-1842) in the university of Pennsylvania,
he entered the United States military academy, from
which he graduated with high honours in July 1846. Sent as
a lieutenant of engineers to the Mexican War, he took part in
the battles under General Scott, and by his gallantry won the
brevets of first-lieutenant at Contreras-Churubusco and captain
at Chapultepec; he was afterwards detailed as assistant-instructor
at West Point, and employed in explorations in the South-West
and in Oregon. Promoted in 1855 captain of cavalry, he served
on a military commission sent to Europe to study European
armies and especially the war in the Crimea. On his return he
furnished an able and interesting report, republished (1861)
under the title of <i>Armies of Europe</i>. In 1856 he designed a saddle,
which was afterwards well known as the McClellan. Resigning
his commission in 1857, McClellan became successively chief
engineer and vice-president of the Illinois Central railroad (1857-1860),
general superintendent of the Mississippi &amp; Ohio railroad,
and, a little later, president of the eastern branch of the same,
with his residence in Cincinnati. When the Civil War broke out
he was, in April 1861, made major-general of three months&rsquo;
militia by the governor of Ohio; but General Scott&rsquo;s favour at
Washington promoted him rapidly (May 14) to the rank of
major-general, U.S.A., in command of the department of the
Ohio. Pursuant to orders, on the 26th of May, McClellan sent
a small force across the Ohio river to Philippi, dispersed the
Confederates there early in June, and immensely aided the Union
cause in that region by rapid and brilliant military successes,
gained in the short space of eight days. These operations,
though comparatively trivial as the Civil War developed,
brought great results, in permanently dividing old Virginia by the
creation of the state of West Virginia, and in presenting the
first sharp, short and wholly successful campaign of the war.</p>

<p>Soon after the first Bull Run disaster he was summoned to
Washington, and the Union hailed him as chieftain and preserver.
Only thirty-four years old, and with military fame and promotion
premature and quite in excess of positive experience, he reached
the capital late in July and assumed command there. At first
all was deference and compliance with his wishes. In November
Scott retired that the young general might control the operations
of the whole Union army. McClellan proved himself extraordinarily
able as an organizer and trainer of soldiers. During
the autumn, winter and spring he created the famous Army
of the Potomac, which in victory and defeat retained to the end
the impress of McClellan&rsquo;s work. But he soon showed petulance
towards the civil authorities, from whom he came to differ concerning
the political ends in view; and he now found severe
critics, who doubted his capacity for directing an offensive war;
but the government yielded to his plans for an oblique, instead
of a direct, movement upon Richmond and the opposing army.
At the moment of starting he was relieved as general-in-chief.
By the 5th of April a great army was safely transported
to Fortress Monroe, and other troops were sent later, though
a large force was (much against his will) retained to cover Washington.
McClellan laid slow siege to Yorktown, not breaking
the thin line first opposed to him, but giving Johnston full time
to reinforce and then evacuate the position. McClellan followed
up the Confederate rearguard and approached Richmond, using
White House on the Pamunkey as a base of supplies; this entailed
a division of his forces on either bank of the Chickahominy. At
Fair Oaks (Seven Pines) was fought on the 31st of May a bloody
battle, ending the following day in a Confederate repulse.
Johnston being severely wounded, Lee came to command on
the Southern side. After a pause in the operations McClellan
felt himself ready to attack at the moment when Lee, leaving
a bare handful of men in the Richmond lines, despatched two-thirds
of his entire force to the north of the Chickahominy to
strike McClellan&rsquo;s isolated right wing. McClellan himself made
little progress, and the troops beyond the Chickahominy were
defeated after a strenuous defence; whereupon McClellan planned,
and during the celebrated Seven Days&rsquo; Battle triumphantly
executed, a change of base to the James river. But the result
was strategically a failure, and General Halleck, who was now
general-in-chief, ordered the army to reinforce General Pope in
central Virginia. The order was obeyed reluctantly.</p>

<p>Pope&rsquo;s disastrous defeats brought McClellan a new opportunity
to retrieve his fame. Again in command of the Army of the
Potomac, he was sent with all available forces to oppose
Lee, who had crossed the Potomac into Maryland early in September.
McClellan advanced slowly and carefully, reorganizing
his army as he went. The battle of South Mountain placed him
in a position to attack Lee, and a few days later was fought the
great battle of Antietam, in which Lee was worsted. But the Confederates
safely recrossed the Potomac, and McClellan showed
his former faults in a tardy pursuit. On the eve of an aggressive
movement, which he was at last about to make, he was superseded
by Burnside (Nov. 7). McClellan was never again
ordered to active command, and the political elements opposed
to the general policy of Lincoln&rsquo;s administration chose him as
presidential candidate in 1864, on a platform which denounced
the war as a failure and proposed negotiating with the South for
peace. McClellan, while accepting his candidacy, repudiated
the platform, like a soldier and patriot. At the polls on the 8th
of November Lincoln was triumphantly re-elected president.
McClellan had previously resigned his commission in the army,
and soon afterwards went to Europe, where he remained until
1868. Upon his return he took up his residence in New York
City, where (1868-1869) he was engaged in superintending the
construction of an experimental floating battery. In 1870-1872
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span>
he was engineer-in-chief of the city&rsquo;s department of docks.
With Orange, N.J., as his next principal residence, he became
governor of New Jersey (1878-1881). During his term he effected
great reforms in the administration of the state and in the militia.
He was offered, but declined, a second nomination. During his
last years he made several tours of Europe, visited the East, and
wrote much for the magazines. He also prepared monographs
upon the Civil War, defending his own action. He died suddenly
of heart-disease on the 29th of October 1885 at Orange.</p>

<p>McClellan was a clear and able writer and effective speaker;
and his <i>Own Story</i>, edited by a friend and published soon after
his death, discloses an honourable character, sensitive to reproach,
and conscientious, even morbidly so, in his patriotism. He
carried himself well in civil life and was of irreproachable private
conduct. During the Civil War, however, he was promoted too
early and rapidly for his own good, and the strong personal
magnetism he inspired while so young developed qualities injurious
to a full measure of success and usefulness, despite his
great opportunities. The reasons for his final displacement in
1862 were both civil and military, and the president had been
forbearing with him. As a soldier he possessed to an extraordinary
degree the enthusiastic affection of his men. With
the army that he had created the mere rumour of his presence
was often a spur to the greatest exertions. That he was slow,
and perhaps too tender-hearted, in handling armed masses for
action may be admitted, and though admirable for defensive
war and a safe strategist, he showed himself unfitted to take the
highly essential initiative, both because of temperament and his
habitual exaggeration of obstacles and opposing numbers. But
he met and checked the armies of the Confederacy when they
were at their best and strongest, and his work laid the foundations
of ultimate success.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">George Brinton Mcclellan</span> (b. 1865), graduated in
1886 at Princeton (from which he received the degree of LL.D. in
1905), and became a newspaper reporter and editor in New York
City. He identified himself with the Tammany Hall organization,
and in 1889-1892 was treasurer of the New York and Brooklyn
Bridge under the city government. In 1892 he was admitted
to the bar, and was elected to the board of aldermen, of which
he was president in 1893 and 1894. In 1895-1903 he was a
Democratic representative in Congress; in 1903 he was elected
mayor of New York City on the Tammany ticket, defeating
mayor Seth Low, the &ldquo;Fusion&rdquo; candidate; and in 1905 he was
re-elected for a four-year term, defeating William M. Ivins
(Republican) and William R. Hearst (Independence League).
He published <i>The Oligarchy of Venice</i> (1904).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Besides the report mentioned above, General McClellan wrote a
<i>Bayonet Exercise</i> (1852); <i>Report on Pacific Railroad Surveys</i> (1854);
<i>Report on the Organization, &amp;c., of the Army of the Potomac</i> (1864), a
government publication which he himself republished with the addition
of a memoir of the West Virginian campaign. He also wrote

<p><span class="bold">McCLERNAND, JOHN ALEXANDER<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> (1812-1900), American
soldier and lawyer, was born in Breckinridge county, Kentucky,
on the 30th of May 1812. He was admitted to the bar in
Shawneetown, Illinois, in 1832; in the same year served as a
volunteer in the Black Hawk War, and in 1835 founded the
<i>Shawneetown Democrat</i>, which he thereafter edited. As a
Democrat he served in 1836 and in 1840-1843 in the Illinois
House of Representatives, and in 1843-1851 and in 1859-1861 was
a representative in Congress, where in his first term he vigorously
opposed the Wilmot proviso, but in his second term was a strong
Unionist and introduced the resolution of the 15th of July 1861,
pledging money and men to the national government. He
resigned from congress, raised in Illinois the &ldquo;McClernand
Brigade,&rdquo; and was commissioned (May 17, 1861) brigadier-general
of volunteers. He was second in command at the battle
of Belmont (Missouri) in November 1861, and commanded the
right wing at Fort Donelson. On the 21st of March he became a
major-general of volunteers. At Shiloh he commanded a division,
which was practically a reserve to Sherman&rsquo;s. In October 1861
Stanton, secretary of war, ordered him north to raise troops
for the expedition against Vicksburg; and early in January
1864, at Milliken&rsquo;s Bend, McClernand, who had been placed in
command of one of the four corps of Grant&rsquo;s army, superseded
Sherman as the leader of the force that was to move down the
Mississippi. On the 11th of January he took Arkansas Post.
On the 17th, Grant, after receiving the opinion of Admiral Foote
and General Sherman that McClernand was unfit, united a part
of his own troops with those of McClernand and assumed command
in person, and three days later ordered McClernand back
to Milliken&rsquo;s Bend. During the rest of this Vicksburg campaign
there was much friction between McClernand and his colleagues;
he undoubtedly intrigued for the removal of Grant; it was
Grant&rsquo;s opinion that at Champion&rsquo;s Hill (May 16) he was
dilatory; and because a congratulatory order to his corps was
published in the press (contrary to an order of the department
and another of Grant) he was relieved of his command on the
18th of June, and was replaced by General E. O. C. Ord. President
Lincoln, who saw the importance of conciliating a leader
of the Illinois War-Democrats, restored him to his command in
1864, but McClernand resigned in November of that year. He
was district judge of the Sangamon (Illinois) District in 1870-1873,
and was president of the National Democratic Convention
in 1876. He died in Springfield, Illinois, on the 20th of September
1900.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Edward John Mcclernand</span> (b. 1848), graduated
at the U.S. Military Academy in 1870. He served on the frontier
against the Indians, notably in the capture of Chief Joseph in
October 1877, became lieutenant-colonel and assistant adjutant-general
of volunteers in 1898, and served in Cuba in 1898-99.
He was then ordered to the Philippines, where he commanded
various districts, and from April 1900 to May 1901, when he was
mustered out of the volunteer service, was acting military
governor.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACCLESFIELD, CHARLES GERARD,<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Earl of</span> (<i>c.</i> 1618-1694),
eldest son of Sir Charles Gerard, was a member of an old
Lancashire family, his great-grandfather having been Sir Gilbert
Gerard (d. 1593) of Ince, in that county, one of the most distinguished
judges in the reign of Elizabeth. His mother was
Penelope Fitton of Gawsworth, Cheshire. Charles Gerard was
educated abroad, and in the Low Countries learnt soldiering, in
which he showed himself proficient when on the outbreak of the
Civil War in England he raised a troop of horse for the king&rsquo;s service.
Gerard commanded a brigade with distinction at Edgehill,
and gained further honours at the first battle of Newbury
and at Newark in 1644, for which service he was appointed to
the chief command in South Wales. Here his operations in
1644 and 1645 were completely successful in reducing the Parliamentarians
to subjection; but the severity with which he ravaged
the country made him personally so unpopular that when, after
the defeat at Naseby in June 1645, the king endeavoured to raise
fresh forces in Wales, he was compelled to remove Gerard from
the local command. Gerard was, however, retained in command
of the king&rsquo;s guard during Charles&rsquo;s march from Wales to Oxford,
and thence to Hereford and Chester in August 1645; and having
been severely wounded at Rowton Heath on the 23rd of September,
he reached Newark with Charles on the 4th of October. On
the 8th of November 1645 he was created Baron Gerard of
Brandon in the county of Suffolk; but about the same time he
appears to have forfeited Charles&rsquo;s favour by having attached
himself to the party of Prince Rupert, with whom after the
surrender of Oxford Gerard probably went abroad. He remained
on the Continent throughout the whole period of the Commonwealth,
sometimes in personal attendance on Charles II., at
others serving in the wars under Turenne, and constantly engaged
in plots and intrigues. For one of these, an alleged
design on the life of Cromwell, his cousin Colonel John Gerard
was executed in the Tower in July 1654. At the Restoration
Gerard rode at the head of the king&rsquo;s life-guards in his triumphal
entry into London; his forfeited estates were restored, and he
received lucrative offices and pensions. In 1668 he retired from
the command of the king&rsquo;s guard to make room for the duke of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span>
Monmouth, receiving, according to Pepys, the sum of £12,000
as solatium. On the 23rd of July 1679 Gerard was created earl
of Macclesfield and Viscount Brandon. A few months later he
entered into relations with Monmouth, and co-operated with
Shaftesbury in protesting against the rejection of the Exclusion
Bill. In September 1685, a proclamation having been issued
for his arrest, Macclesfield escaped abroad, and was outlawed.
He returned with William of Orange in 1688, and commanded
his body-guard in the march from Devonshire to London. By
William he was made a privy councillor, and lord lieutenant of
Wales and three western counties. Macclesfield died on the 7th
of January 1694. By his French wife he left two sons and two
daughters.</p>

<p>His eldest son <span class="sc">Charles</span>, 2nd earl of Macclesfield (<i>c.</i> 1659-1701),
was born in France and was naturalized in England by
act of parliament in 1677. Like his father he was concerned in
the intrigues of the duke of Monmouth; in 1685 he was sentenced
to death for being a party to the Rye House plot, but was
pardoned by the king. In 1689 he was elected member of parliament
for Lancashire, which he represented till 1694, when he
succeeded to his father&rsquo;s peerage. Having become a major-general
in the same year, Macclesfield saw some service abroad;
and in 1701 he was selected first commissioner for the investiture
of the elector of Hanover (afterwards King George I.) with the
order of the Garter, on which occasion he also was charged to
present a copy of the Act of Settlement to the dowager electress
Sophia. He died on the 5th of November 1701, leaving no
legitimate children.</p>

<p>In March 1698 Macclesfield was divorced from his wife Anna,
daughter of Sir Richard Mason of Sutton, by act of parliament,
the first occasion on which a divorce was so granted without
a previous decree of an ecclesiastical court. The countess was
the mother of two children, who were known by the name of
Savage, and whose reputed father was Richard Savage, 4th Earl
Rivers (d. 1712). The poet Richard Savage (<i>q.v.</i>) claimed that
he was the younger of these children. The divorced countess
married Colonel Henry Brett about the year 1700, and died at
the age of eighty-five in 1753. Her daughter Anna Margaretta
Brett was a mistress of George I. The 2nd earl of Macclesfield
was succeeded by his brother Fitton Gerard, 3rd earl (<i>c.</i> 1665-1702),
on whose death without heirs the title became extinct
in December 1702.</p>

<p>In 1721 the title of earl of Macclesfield was revived in favour
of <span class="sc">Thomas Parker</span> (<i>c.</i> 1666-1732). The son of Thomas Parker,
an attorney at Leek, young Parker was a student at Trinity
College, Cambridge, and became a barrister in 1691. In 1705
he was elected member of parliament for Derby, and having
gained some reputation in his profession, he took a leading part
in the proceedings against Sacheverell in 1710. In the same
year he was appointed lord chief justice of the queen&rsquo;s bench,
but he refused to become lord chancellor in the following year;
however he accepted this office in 1718, two years after he had
been made Baron Parker of Macclesfield by George I., who held
him in high esteem. In 1721 he was created Viscount Parker
and earl of Macclesfield, but when serious charges of corruption
were brought against him he resigned his position as lord chancellor
in 1725. In the same year Macclesfield was impeached,
and although he made a very able defence he was found guilty
by the House of Lords. His sentence was a fine of £30,000 and
imprisonment until this was paid. He was confined in the
Tower of London for six weeks, and after his release he took no
further part in public affairs. The earl, who built a grammar
school at Leek, died in London on the 28th of April 1732.</p>

<p>Macclesfield&rsquo;s only son, <span class="sc">George</span>, (<i>c.</i> 1697-1764) 2nd earl of
Macclesfield of this line, was celebrated as an astronomer.
As Viscount Parker he was member of parliament for Wallingford
from 1722 to 1727, but his interests were not in politics.
In 1722 he became a fellow of the Royal Society, and he spent
most of his time in astronomical observations at his Oxfordshire
seat, Shirburn Castle, which had been bought by his father in
1716; here he built an observatory and a chemical laboratory.
The earl was very prominent in effecting the change from the old
to the new style of dates, which came into operation in 1752.
His action in this matter, however, was somewhat unpopular,
as the opinion was fairly general that he had robbed the people
of eleven days. From 1752 until his death on the 17th of March
1764 Macclesfield was president of the Royal Society, and
he made some observations on the great earthquake of 1755.
His successor was his son Thomas (1723-1795), from whom the
present earl is descended.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACCLESFIELD,<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> a market town and municipal borough in
the Macclesfield parliamentary division of Cheshire, England,
166 m. N.W. by N. of London, on the London &amp; North-Western,
North Staffordshire and Great Central railways. Pop. (1901),
34,624. It lies on and above the small river Bollin, the valley
of which is flanked by high ground to east and west, the eastern
hills rising sharply to heights above 1000 ft. The bleak upland
country retains its ancient name of Macclesfield Forest. The
church of St Michael, standing high, was founded by Eleanor,
queen of Edward I., in 1278, and in 1740 was partly rebuilt and
greatly enlarged. The lofty steeple by which its massive tower
was formerly surmounted was battered down by the Parliamentary
forces during the Civil War. Connected with the
Church there are two chapels, one of which, Rivers Chapel,
belonged to a college of secular priests founded in 1501 by Thomas
Savage, afterwards archbishop of York. Both the church and
chapels contain several ancient monuments. The free grammar
school, originally founded in 1502 by Sir John Percival, was
refounded in 1552 by Edward VI., and a commercial school was
erected in 1840 out of its funds. The county lunatic asylum
is situated here. The town-hall is a handsome modern building
with a Grecian frontage on two sides. Originally the trade of
Macclesfield was principally in twist and silk buttons, but this
has developed into the manufacture of all kinds of silk. Besides
this staple trade, there are various textile manufactures and
extensive breweries; while stone and slate quarries, as well as
coal-mines, are worked in the neighbourhood. Recreation
grounds include Victoria Park and Peel Park, in which are
preserved the old market cross and stocks. Water communication
is provided by the Macclesfield canal. The borough is under
a mayor, 12 aldermen and 36 councillors. Area, 3214 acres.
The populous suburb of <span class="sc">Sutton</span>, extending S.S.E. of the town,
is partly included in the borough.</p>

<p>Previous to the Conquest, Macclesfield (Makesfeld, Mackerfeld,
Macclesfeld, Meulefeld, Maxfield) was held by Edwin, earl
of Mercia, and at the time of the Domesday Survey it formed a
part of the lands of the earl of Chester. The entry speaks of
seven hedged enclosures, and there is evidence of fortification
in the 13th century, to which the names Jordangate, Chestergate
and Wallgate still bear witness. In the 15th century Henry
Stafford, duke of Buckingham, had a fortified manor-house here,
traces of which remain. There is a tradition, supported by a
reference on a plea roll, that Randle, earl of Chester (1181-1232)
made Macclesfield a free borough, but the earliest charter extant
is that granted by Edward, prince of Wales and earl of Chester,
in 1261, constituting Macclesfield a free borough with a merchant
gild, and according certain privileges in the royal forest of Macclesfield
to the burgesses. This charter was confirmed by
Edward III. in 1334, by Richard II. in 1389, by Edward IV. in
1466 and by Elizabeth in 1564. In 1595 Elizabeth issued a new
charter to the town, confirmed by James I. in 1605 and Charles II.
in 1666, laying down a formal borough constitution under a
mayor, 2 aldermen, 24 capital burgesses and a high steward. In
1684 Charles II. issued a new charter, under which the borough
was governed until the Municipal Reform Act 1835. The earliest
mention of a market is in a grant by James I. to Charles, prince
of Wales and earl of Chester, in 1617. In the charter of 1666 a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span>
market is included among the privileges confirmed to the borough
as those which had been granted in 1605, or by any previous
kings and queens of England. The charter of Elizabeth in 1595
granted an annual fair in June, and this was supplemented by
Charles II. in 1684 by a grant of fairs in April and September.
Except during the three winter months fairs are now held
monthly, the chief being &ldquo;Barnaby&rdquo; in June, when the town
keeps a week&rsquo;s holiday. Macclesfield borough sent two members
to parliament in 1832 for the first time. In 1880 it was disfranchised
for bribery, and in 1885 the borough was merged in
the county division of Macclesfield. The manufacture of silk-covered
buttons began in the 16th century, and flourished until
the early 18th. The first silk mill was erected about 1755, and
silk manufacture on a large scale was introduced about 1790.
The manufacture of cotton began in Macclesfield about 1785.</p>

<p><span class="bold">M&lsquo;CLINTOCK, SIR FRANCIS LEOPOLD<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> (1819-1907), British
naval officer and Arctic explorer, was born at Dundalk, Ireland,
on the 8th of July 1819, of a family of Scottish origin. In 1831
he entered the royal navy, joining the &ldquo;Samarang&rdquo; frigate,
Captain Charles Paget. In 1843 he passed his examination for
lieutenancy and joined the &ldquo;Gorgon&rdquo; steamship, Captain
Charles Hotham, which was driven ashore at Montevideo and
salved, a feat of seamanship on the part of her captain and officers
which attracted much attention. Hitherto, and until 1847,
M&lsquo;Clintock&rsquo;s service was almost wholly on the American coasts,
but in 1848 he joined the Arctic expedition under Sir James Ross
in search of Sir John Franklin&rsquo;s ships, as second lieutenant of
the &ldquo;Enterprise.&rdquo; In the second search expedition (1850) he
was first lieutenant of the &ldquo;Assistance,&rdquo; and in the third (1854)
he commanded the &ldquo;Intrepid.&rdquo; On all these expeditions
M&lsquo;Clintock carried out brilliant sleigh journeys, and gained
recognition as one of the highest authorities on Arctic travel.
The direction which the search should follow had at last been
learnt from the Eskimo, and M&lsquo;Clintock accepted the command
of the expedition on board the &ldquo;Fox,&rdquo; fitted out by Lady
Franklin in 1857, which succeeded in its object in 1859 (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Franklin, Sir John</a></span>). For this expedition M&lsquo;Clintock had
obtained leave of absence, but the time occupied was afterwards
counted in his service. He was knighted and received many other
honours on his return. Active service now occupied him in
various tasks, including the important one of sounding in the
north Atlantic, in connexion with a scheme for a north Atlantic
cable route, until 1868. In that year he became naval aide-de-camp
to Queen Victoria. In 1865 he had been elected a fellow
of the Royal Society. He unsuccessfully contested a seat in
parliament for the borough of Drogheda, where he made the
acquaintance of Annette Elizabeth, daughter of R. F. Dunlop
of Monasterboice; he married her in 1870. He became vice-admiral
in 1877, and commander-in-chief on the West Indian
and North American station in 1879. In 1882 he was elected
an Elder Brother of Trinity House, and served actively in that
capacity. In 1891 he was created K.C.B. He was one of the
principal advisers in the preparations for the Antarctic voyage
of the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; under Captain Scott. His book, <i>The Voyage
of the &ldquo;Fox&rdquo; in the Arctic Seas</i>, was first published in 1859,
and passed through several editions. He died on the 17th of
November 1907.</p>

<p><span class="bold">McCLINTOCK, JOHN<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span> (1814-1870), American Methodist
Episcopal theologian and educationalist, was born in Philadelphia
on the 27th of October 1814. He graduated at the
university of Pennsylvania in 1835, and was assistant professor
of mathematics (1836-1837), professor of mathematics (1837-1840),
and professor of Latin and Greek (1840-1848) in Dickinson
College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He opposed the Mexican War
and slavery, and in 1847 was arrested on the charge of instigating
a riot, which resulted in the rescue of several fugitive slaves;
his trial, in which he was acquitted, attracted wide attention.
In 1848-1856 he edited <i>The Methodist Quarterly Review</i> (after
1885 <i>The Methodist Review</i>); from 1857 to 1860 he was pastor
of St Paul&rsquo;s (Methodist Episcopal) Church, New York City;
and in 1860-1864 he had charge of the American chapel in Paris,
and there and in London did much to turn public opinion in
favour of the Northern States. In 1865-1866 he was chairman
of the central committee for the celebration of the centenary
of American Methodism. He retired from the regular ministry
in 1865, but preached in New Brunswick, New Jersey, until
the spring of 1867, and in that year, at the wish of its founder,
Daniel Drew, became president of the newly established Drew
theological seminary at Madison, New Jersey, where he died
on the 4th of March 1870. A great preacher, orator and teacher,
and a remarkably versatile scholar, McClintock by his editorial
and educational work probably did more than any other man
to raise the intellectual tone of American Methodism, and, particularly,
of the American Methodist clergy. He introduced to
his denomination the scholarly methods of the new German
theology of the day&mdash;not alone by his translation with Charles E.
Blumenthal of Neander&rsquo;s <i>Life of Christ</i> (1847), and of Bungener&rsquo;s
<i>History of the Council of Trent</i> (1855), but by his great project,
McClintock and Strong&rsquo;s <i>Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological
and Ecclesiastical Literature</i> (10 vols., 1867-1881; Supplement,
2 vols., 1885-1887), in the editing of which he was associated with
Dr James Strong (1822-1894), professor of exegetical theology
in the Drew Theological Seminary from 1868 to 1893, and the
sole editor of the last six volumes of the <i>Cyclopaedia</i> and of
the supplement. With George Richard Crooks (1822-1897), his
colleague at Dickinson College and in 1880-1897 professor of
historical theology at Drew Seminary, McClintock edited several
elementary textbooks in Latin and Greek (of which some were
republished in Spanish), based on the pedagogical principle of
&ldquo;imitation and constant repetition.&rdquo; Among McClintock&rsquo;s
other publications are: <i>Sketches of Eminent Methodist Ministers</i>
(1863); an edition of Richard Watson&rsquo;s <i>Theological Institutes</i>
(1851); and <i>The Life and Letters of Rev. Stephen Olin</i> (1854).</p>

<p><span class="bold">McCLOSKEY, JOHN<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> (1810-1885), American cardinal, was
born in Brooklyn, New York, on the 20th of March 1810. He
graduated at Mt St Mary&rsquo;s College, Emmitsburg, Maryland, in
1827, studied theology there, was ordained a priest in 1834, and
in 1837, after two years in the college of the Propaganda at Rome,
became rector of St Joseph&rsquo;s, New York City, a charge to which
he returned in 1842 after one year&rsquo;s presidency of St John&rsquo;s
College (afterwards Fordham University), Fordham, New York,
then just opened. In 1844 he was consecrated bishop of
Axieren <i>in partibus</i>, and was made coadjutor to Bishop Hughes
of New York with the right of succession; in 1847 he became
bishop of the newly created see of Albany; and in 1864 he
succeeded to the archdiocese of New York, then including New
York, New Jersey, and New England. In April 1875 he was
invested as a cardinal, with the title of Sancta Maria supra
Minervam, being the first American citizen to receive this
dignity. He attended the conclave of 1878, but was too late
to vote for the new pope. In May 1879 he dedicated St Patrick&rsquo;s
Cathedral in New York City, whose corner-stone had been laid
by Archbishop Hughes in 1858. Archbishop Corrigan became
his coadjutor in 1880 because of the failure of McCloskey&rsquo;s
always delicate health. The fiftieth anniversary of his ordination
to the priesthood was celebrated in 1884. He died in
New York City on the 10th of October 1885. He was a scholar,
a preacher, and a man of affairs, temperamentally quiet and
dignified; and his administration differed radically from that
of Archbishop Hughes; he was conciliatory rather than polemic
and controversial, and not only built up the Roman Catholic
Church materially, but greatly changed the tone of public
opinion in his diocese toward the Church.</p>

captains and spent his childhood under the care of
his godfather, General Le Mesurier, governor of Alderney, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span>
whom he was educated for the army. He entered the navy,
however, in 1824, and twelve years later gained his first experience
of Arctic exploration as mate of the &ldquo;Terror&rdquo; in the
expedition (1836-1837) commanded by Captain (afterwards Sir)
George Back. On his return he obtained his commission as
lieutenant, and from 1838 to 1839 served on the Canadian lakes,
being subsequently attached to the North American and West
Indian naval stations, where he remained till 1846. Two
years later he joined the Franklin search expedition (1848-1849)
under Sir J. C. Ross as first lieutenant of the &ldquo;Enterprise,&rdquo;
and on the return of this expedition was given the command of
the &ldquo;Investigator&rdquo; in the new search expedition (1850-1854)
which was sent out by way of Bering Strait to co-operate with
another from the north-west. In the course of this voyage he
achieved the distinction of completing (1830) the work connected
with the discovery of a North-West Passage (see Polar Regions).
On his return to England, M&lsquo;Clure was awarded gold medals
by the English and French geographical societies, was knighted
and promoted to post-rank, his commission being dated back
four years in recognition of his special services. From 1856 to
1861 he served in Eastern waters, commanding the division of
the naval brigade before Canton in 1858, for which he received
a C.B. in the following year. His latter years were spent in a
quiet country life; he attained the rank of rear-admiral in
1867, and of vice-admiral in 1873.</p>

publicist, was the son of a Scottish farmer. He was educated at
Trinity College, Glenalmond, for the Scotch Episcopal ministry,
and after further study at the university of Naples was ordained
in 1859, and entered on a succession of curacies in the Church of
England, in London and at Addington, Bucks. He quickly
became known as a political and ecclesiastical controversialist,
wielding an active pen in support of W. E. Gladstone, who
rewarded him with the living of St George&rsquo;s, Botolph Lane,
in 1871, and with a canonry of Ripon in 1884. The living was
practically a sinecure, and he devoted himself to political
pamphleteering and newspaper correspondence, the result of
extensive European travel, a wide acquaintance with the
leading personages of the day, strong views on ecclesiastical subjects
from a high-church standpoint, and particularly on the
politics of the Eastern Question and Mahommedanism. He
took a leading part in ventilating the Bulgarian and Armenian
&ldquo;atrocities,&rdquo; and his combative personality was constantly
to the fore in support of the campaigns of Gladstonian Liberalism.

<p><span class="bold">MacCORMAC, SIR WILLIAM,<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span> <span class="sc">Bart.</span> (1836-1901), Irish
surgeon, was born at Belfast on the 17th of January 1836,
being the son of Dr Henry MacCormac. He studied medicine
and surgery at Belfast, Dublin and Paris, and graduated in
arts, medicine and surgery at the Queen&rsquo;s University of Ireland,
in which he afterwards became an examiner in surgery. He
began practice in Belfast, where he became surgeon to the
General Hospital, but left it for London on his marriage in 1861
to Miss Katherine M. Charters. In the Franco-German War of
1870 he was surgeon-in-chief to the Anglo-American Ambulance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span>
and was present at Sedan; and he also went through the Turco-Servian
War of 1876. He became in this way an authority on
gun-shot wounds, and besides being highly successful as a surgeon
was very popular in society, his magnificent physique and Irish
temperament making him a notable and attractive personality.
In 1881 he was appointed assistant-surgeon at St Thomas&rsquo;s
Hospital, London, and for twenty years continued his work
there as surgeon, lecturer and consulting surgeon. In 1881 he
acted as honorary secretary-general of the International Medical
Congress in London, and was knighted for his services. In
1883 he was elected member of the council of the College of
Surgeons, and in 1887 a member of the court of examiners; in
1893 he delivered the Bradshaw lecture, and in 1896 was elected
president, being re-elected to this office in 1897, 1898, 1899, and
1900 (the centenary year of the college), an unprecedented
record. In 1897 he was created a baronet, and appointed
surgeon-in-ordinary to the prince of Wales. In 1899 he was
Hunterian Orator. In the same year he volunteered to go out
to South Africa as consulting surgeon to the forces, and from
November 1899 to April 1900 he saw much active service both
in Cape Colony and Natal, his assistance being cordially acknowledged
on his return. In 1901 he was appointed honorary
serjeant-surgeon to the king. But during 1898 he had suffered
from a prolonged illness, and he had perhaps put too much
strain on his strength, for on the 4th of December 1901 he died
somewhat suddenly at Bath. Besides treatises on <i>Surgical
Operations</i> and <i>Antiseptic Surgery</i>, and numerous contributions
to the medical journals, MacCormac was the author of <i>Work
under the Red Cross</i> and of an interesting volume commemorating
the centenary of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1900.
The latter contains biographical notices of all the masters and
presidents up to that date.</p>

of grain-harvesting machinery, was born at Walnut Grove, in

1809. His father was a farmer who had invented numerous
labour-saving devices for farmwork, but after repeated efforts
had failed in his attempts to construct a successful grain-cutting
machine. In 1831, Cyrus, then twenty-two years old, took
up the problem, and after careful study constructed a machine
which was successfully employed in the late harvest of 1831 and
patented in 1834. The McCormick reaper after further improvements
proved a complete success; and in 1847 the inventor
removed to Chicago, where he established large works for manufacturing
his agricultural machines. William H. Seward has
said of McCormick&rsquo;s invention, that owing to it &ldquo;the line of
civilization moves westward thirty miles each year.&rdquo; Numerous
prizes and medals were awarded for his reaper, and he was
elected a corresponding member of the French Academy of
Sciences, &ldquo;as having done more for the cause of agriculture
than any other living man.&rdquo; He died in Chicago on the 13th

administration, a good lecturer and an effective preacher. His
general philosophical attitude and method were Hamiltonian;
he insisted on severing religious and philosophical data from
merely physical, and though he added little to original thought,
he clearly restated and vigorously used the conclusions of
others. In his controversial writings he often failed to understand
the real significance of the views which he attacked, and

<p><span class="bold">McCOY, SIR FREDERICK<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> (1823-1899), British palaeontologist,
the son of Dr Simon McCoy, was born in Dublin in 1823,
and was educated in that city for the medical profession. His
interests, however, became early centred in natural history,
and especially in geology, and at the age of eighteen he published
a <i>Catalogue of Organic Remains</i> compiled from specimens
exhibited in the Rotunda at Dublin (1841). He assisted Sir
R. J. Griffith (<i>q.v.</i>) by studying the fossils of the carboniferous
and silurian rocks of Ireland, and they prepared a joint <i>Synopsis
of the Silurian Fossils of Ireland</i> (1846). In 1846 Sedgwick
secured his services, and for at least four years he devoted
himself to the determination and arrangement of the fossils
in the Woodwardian Museum at Cambridge. Sedgwick wrote
of him as &ldquo;an excellent naturalist, an incomparable and most
philosophical palaeontologist, and one of the steadiest and
quickest workmen that ever undertook the arrangement of a
museum&rdquo; (<i>Life and Letters of Sedgwick</i>, ii. 194). Together
they prepared the important and now classic work entitled
<i>A Synopsis of the Classification of the British Palaeozoic
Rocks, with a Systematic Description of the British Palaeozoic
Fossils in the Geological Museum of the University of Cambridge</i>
(1855). Meanwhile McCoy in 1850 had been appointed professor
of geology in Queen&rsquo;s College, Belfast, and in 1854 he
accepted the newly founded professorship of natural science in
the university of Melbourne. There he lectured for upwards
of thirty years; he established the National Museum of Natural
History and Geology in Melbourne, of which he was director;
and becoming associated with the geological survey of Victoria
as palaeontologist, he issued a series of decades entitled <i>Prodromus
of the Palaeontology of Victoria</i>. He also issued the
<i>Prodromus of the Zoology of Victoria</i>. To local societies he
contributed many papers, and he continued his active scientific
work for fifty-eight years&mdash;his last contribution, &ldquo;Note on a new
Australian Pterygotus,&rdquo; being printed in the <i>Geological Magazine</i>
for May 1899. He was elected F.R.S. in 1880, and was one
of the first to receive the Hon. D.Sc. from the university of
Cambridge. In 1886 he was made C.M.G., and in 1891 K.C.M.G.
He died in Melbourne on the 16th of May 1899.</p>

<p><span class="bold">M&lsquo;CRIE, THOMAS<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span> (1772-1835), Scottish historian and divine,
was born at Duns in Berwickshire in November 1772. He
studied in Edinburgh University, and in 1796 he was ordained
minister of the Second Associate Congregation, Edinburgh. In
1806, however, with some others M&lsquo;Crie seceded from the
&ldquo;general associate synod,&rdquo; and formed the &ldquo;constitutional
associate presbytery,&rdquo; afterwards merged in the &ldquo;original
seceders.&rdquo; He was consequently deposed by the associate
synod, and his congregation withdrew with him and built
another place of worship in which he officiated until his death.
M&lsquo;Crie devoted himself to investigations into the history,
constitution and polity of the churches of the Reformation;
and the first-fruits of his study were given to the public in
November 1811 as <i>The Life of John Knox, containing Illustrations
of the History of the Reformation in Scotland</i>, which procured
for the author the degree of D.D. from Edinburgh University,
an honour conferred then for the first time upon a Scottish
dissenting minister. This work, of great learning and value,
exercised an important influence on public opinion at the time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span>
At the solicitation of his friend Andrew Thomson, M&lsquo;Crie
became a contributor to <i>The Edinburgh Christian Instructor</i>,
and in 1817 he subjected some of Sir W. Scott&rsquo;s works to a
criticism which took the form of a vindication of the Covenanters.
Preserving the continuity of his historical studies, he followed
up his first work with <i>The Life of Andrew Melville</i> (1819). In
1827 he published a <i>History of the Progress and Suppression
of the Reformation in Italy</i>, and in 1829 a <i>History of the Progress
and Suppression of the Reformation in Spain</i>.</p>

<p>His latest literary undertaking was a life of John Calvin.
Only three chapters were completed when the writer died on
the 5th of August 1835, leaving four sons and one daughter.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACCULLAGH, JAMES<a name="ar142" id="ar142"></a></span> (1809-1847), Irish mathematician
and physicist, was born in 1809, near Strabane, Ireland. After
a brilliant career at Trinity College, Dublin, he was elected
fellow in 1832. From 1832 to 1843 he held the chair of mathematics;
and during his tenure of this post he improved in a
most marked manner the position of his university as a mathematical
centre. In 1843 he was transferred to the chair of
natural philosophy. Overwork, mainly on subjects beyond
the natural range of his powers, induced mental disease; and
he died by his own hand in October 1847.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His <i>Works</i> were published in 1880. Their distinguishing feature
is the geometry&mdash;which has rarely been applied either to pure space
problems or to known physical questions such as the rotation of a
rigid solid or the properties of Fresnel&rsquo;s wave-surface with such
singular elegance; in this respect his work takes rank with that of
Louis Poinsot. One specially remarkable geometrical discovery of
MacCullagh&rsquo;s is that of the &ldquo;modular generation of surfaces of the
second degree&rdquo;; and a noteworthy contribution to physical optics
is his &ldquo;theorem of the polar plane.&rdquo; But his methods, which, in
less known subjects, were almost entirely tentative, were altogether
inadequate to the solution of the more profound physical problems
to which his attention was mainly devoted, such as the theory of
double refraction, &amp;c. See G. G. Stokes&rsquo;s &ldquo;Report on Double
Refraction&rdquo; (<i>B. A. Report</i>, 1862).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACCULLOCH, HORATIO<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span> (1805-1867), Scottish landscape
painter, was born in Glasgow. He studied for a year under
John Knox, a Glasgow landscapist of some repute, was then
engaged at Cumnock, painting the ornamental lids of snuff-boxes,
and afterwards employed in Edinburgh by Lizars, the
engraver, to colour the illustrations in Selby&rsquo;s <i>British Birds</i> and
similar works. Meanwhile he was working unweariedly from
nature, greatly influenced in his early practice by the watercolours
of H. W. Williams. Returning to Glasgow in some four
or five years, he was employed on several large pictures for the
decoration of a public hall in St George&rsquo;s Place, and he did a
little as a theatrical scene-painter. About this time he was
greatly impressed with a picture by Thomson of Duddingston.
Gradually MacCulloch asserted his individuality, and formed his
own style on a close study of nature; his works form an interesting
link between the old world of Scottish landscape and the
new. In 1829 MacCulloch first figured in the Royal Scottish
Academy&rsquo;s exhibition, and year by year, till his death on the
24th of June 1867, he was a regular exhibitor. In 1838 he was
elected a member of the Scottish Academy. The subjects of
his numerous landscapes were taken almost exclusively from
Scottish scenery.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Several works by MacCulloch were engraved by William Miller and
William Forrest, and a volume of photographs from his landscapes,
with an excellent biographical notice of the artist by Alexander
Fraser, R.S.A., was published in Edinburgh in 1872.</p>

<p><span class="bold">McCULLOCH, HUGH<a name="ar144" id="ar144"></a></span> (1808-1895), American financier, was
born at Kennebunk, Maine, on the 7th of December 1808. He
was educated at Bowdoin College, studied law in Boston, and
in 1833 began practice at Fort Wayne, Indiana. He was cashier
and manager of the Fort Wayne branch of the old state bank
of Indiana from 1835 to 1857, and president of the new state
bank from 1857 to 1863. Notwithstanding his opposition to
the National Banking Act of 1862, he was selected by Secretary
Chase as comptroller of the currency in 1863 to put the new
system into operation. His work was so successful that he was
appointed secretary of the treasury by President Lincoln in
1865, and was continued in office by President Johnson until the
close of his administration in 1869. In his first annual report,
issued on the 4th of December 1865, he strongly urged the
retirement of the legal tenders or greenbacks as a preliminary
to the resumption of specie payments. In accordance with this
suggestion an act was passed, on the 12th of March 1866, authorizing
the retirement of not more than $10,000,000 in six months
and not more than $4,000,000 per month thereafter, but it met
with strong opposition and was repealed on the 4th of February
1868, after only $48,000,000 had been retired. He was much
disappointed by the decision of the United States Supreme
Court upholding the constitutionality of the legal tenders (12
Wallace 457). Soon after the close of his term of office McCulloch
went to England, and spent six years (1870-1876) as a member
of the banking firm of Jay Cooke, McCulloch &amp; Co. From
October 1884 until the close of President Arthur&rsquo;s term of office
in March 1885 he was again secretary of the treasury. He died
at his home near Washington, D.C., on the 24th of May 1895.</p>

<p><span class="bold">M&lsquo;CULLOCH, SIR JAMES<a name="ar145" id="ar145"></a></span> (1819-1893), Australian statesman,
was born in Glasgow. He entered the house of Dennistoun
Brothers, became a partner, and went to Melbourne to open a
branch. In 1854, shortly after his arrival in Victoria, he was
appointed a nominee member of the Legislative Council, and in
the first Legislative Assembly under the new constitution was
returned for the electorate of the Wimmera. In 1857 he was
appointed minister of trade and customs in the second ministry
of Haines, which lasted till 1858, and subsequently he became
treasurer in the Nicholson administration, which held office
from October 1859 to November 1860. In June 1862 the third
O&rsquo;Shanassy ministry was defeated by a combination between
a section of its supporters led by M&lsquo;Culloch and the opposition
proper under Heales, and M&lsquo;Culloch became premier and chief
secretary. Hitherto he had been regarded as a supporter of
the landed, squatting and importing interests, but the coalition
ministry introduced a number of measures which at the time
were regarded by the propertied classes in the colony as revolutionary.
In addition to passing a Land Bill, which extended
the principle of free selection and deferred payments, the ministry
announced their intention of reducing the duties on the export
of gold and the import duties upon tea and sugar, and of supplying
the deficiency by the imposition of duties ranging from 5 to
10% upon a number of articles which entered into competition
with the local industries, thus introducing protection. The
mercantile community took alarm at the proposal, and at the
general election of 1864 the ministerial policy was warmly
opposed. But a majority was returned in its favour, and a new
tariff was carried through the popular branch of the legislature.
There was no probability of its being assented to by the Council,
which, under the constitution, had the power of rejecting,
although it could not amend, any money Bill. The government
therefore decided upon tacking the tariff to the Appropriation
Bill, and compelling the Council either to agree to the new fiscal
proposals or to refuse to pay the public creditors and the civil
servants. The Council accepted the challenge, and rejected
the Appropriation Bill. But M&lsquo;Culloch and his colleagues
would not give way. They continued to collect the new duties
under the authority of the Assembly, and took advantage of a
clause in the Audit Act which directed the governor to sign the
necessary warrants for the payment of any sum awarded by
verdicts in the supreme court in favour of persons who had sued
the government. M&lsquo;Culloch borrowed £40,000 from the London
Chartered Bank, of which he was a director, to meet pressing
payments, and the bank at his instigation sued the government
for the amount of the advance. The attorney-general at once
accepted judgment, and the governor, who had placed himself
unreservedly in the hands of his ministers, signed the necessary
warrant, and the Treasury repaid to the bank the amount of its
advance, plus interest and costs. In the next session the tariff
was again sent up to the Council, which promptly rejected it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>208</span>
whereupon the ministry dissolved the assembly and appealed
to the country. The result of the general election was to
increase M&lsquo;Culloch&rsquo;s majority, and the tariff was again sent to
the Council, only to be again rejected. M&lsquo;Culloch resigned, but
no member of the opposition was willing to form a ministry,
and he resumed office. Eventually a conference between the
two houses was held, and the Council passed the tariff, after a
few modifications in it had been agreed to by the Assembly.
Just at the moment that peace was restored, the governor,
Sir Charles Darling, was recalled by the home government, on
the ground that he had displayed partisanship by assisting
M&lsquo;Culloch&rsquo;s government and their majority in the Assembly to
coerce the Council. In order to show their gratitude to the dismissed
governor, the Assembly decided to grant a sum of £20,000
to Lady Darling. The home government intimated that Sir
Charles Darling must retire from the Colonial service if this gift
were accepted by his wife, but M&lsquo;Culloch included the money in
the annual Appropriation Bill, with the result that it was rejected
by the Council. The new governor, Viscount Canterbury,
was less complaisant than his predecessor, but after an unsuccessful
attempt to obtain other advisers, he agreed to recommend
the Council to pass the Appropriation Bill with the £20,000 grant
included. The Upper House declined to adopt this course, and
again rejected the Bill. A long and bitter struggle between
the two Chambers ended in another general election in 1868,
which still further increased the ministerial majority; but Lord
Canterbury, in obedience to instructions from the colonial office,
declined to do anything to facilitate the passage of the Darling
grant. M&lsquo;Culloch resigned, and after protracted negotiations
Sir Charles Sladen formed from the minority in the Assembly a
ministry which only lasted two months. The deadlock seemed
likely to become more stringent than ever, when a communication
was received from Sir Charles Darling, that neither he nor
his wife could receive anything like a donation from the people
of Victoria. The attempt to pass the grant was therefore abandoned,
and in July 1868 M&lsquo;Culloch resumed office with different
colleagues, but resigned in the following year, when he was
knighted. He formed a third ministry in 1870. During this
third administration he passed a measure through both Houses
which secured a life annuity of £1000 per annum to Lady Darling.
Additional taxation being necessary, Sir James M&lsquo;Culloch was
urged by his protectionist supporters to increase the import
duties, but he refused, and proposed to provide for the deficit
by levying a tax upon town, suburban and country property.
This proposal was defeated in the Assembly; Sir James resigned
in June 1871, and was appointed agent-general for Victoria in
London. He held that appointment till 1873, was created
K.C.M.G. in 1874, returned to the colony the same year, and
in 1875 formed his fourth and last ministry, which kept power
till May 1877, when his party was defeated at the general election.
During his eighteen months of office he had to encounter
a persistent opposition from Berry and his followers, who
systematically obstructed the business of the Assembly, on the
ground that the acting-governor, Sir William Stawell, had
improperly refused a dissolution. Sir James M&lsquo;Culloch, to
counteract this obstruction, invented the closure, which was
afterwards introduced with some modifications into the house
of commons. After his defeat in 1877 Sir James retired from
public life and returned to England, where he died on the 30th
of January 1893 at Ewell, Surrey. He was twice married&mdash;first,
in 1841, to Susan, daughter of the Rev. James Renwick, of
Muirton, Scotland; secondly, in 1867, to Margaret, daughter
of William Inglis, of Walflat, Dumbartonshire. He left the
house of Dennistoun Brothers in 1862, and founded a new firm
at Melbourne in conjunction with Leishman, Inglis &amp; Co. of
London, under the title of M&lsquo;Culloch, Sellars &amp; Co. He held
several important commercial positions, and was president of
the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACCULLOCH, JOHN<a name="ar146" id="ar146"></a></span> (1773-1835), Scottish geologist, descended
from the Maccullochs of Nether Ardwell in Galloway,
was born in Guernsey, on the 6th of October 1773, his mother
being a native of that island. Having displayed remarkable
powers as a boy, he was sent to study medicine in the university
of Edinburgh, where he qualified as M.D. in 1793, and then
entered the army as assistant surgeon. Attaching himself to
the artillery, he became chemist to the board of ordnance (1803).
He still continued, however, to practise for a time as a physician,
and during the years 1807-1811 he resided at Blackheath. In
1811 he communicated his first papers to the Geological Society.
They were devoted to an elucidation of the geological structure
of Guernsey, of the Channel Islands, and of Heligoland. The
evidence they afforded of his capacity, and the fact that he
already had received a scientific appointment, probably led to
his being selected in the same year to make some geological and
mineralogical investigations in Scotland. He was asked to
report upon stones adapted for use in powder-mills, upon the
suitability of the chief Scottish mountains for a repetition of
the pendulum experiments previously conducted by Maskelyne
and Playfair at Schiehallion, and on the deviations of the
plumb-line along the meridian of the Trigonometrical Survey.
In the course of the explorations necessary for the purposes of
these reports he made extensive observations on the geology
and mineralogy of Scotland. He formed also a collection of
the mineral productions and rocks of that country, which he
presented to the Geological Society in 1814. In that year he
was appointed geologist to the Trigonometrical Survey; and in
1816-1817 he was president of the Geological Society. Comparatively
little had been done in the investigation of Scottish
geology, and finding the field so full of promise, he devoted
himself to its cultivation with great ardour. One of his most
important labours was the examination of the whole range of
islands along the west of Scotland, at that time not easily
visited, and presenting many obstacles to a scientific explorer.
The results of this survey appeared (1819) in the form of his
<i>Description of the Western Islands of Scotland, including the Isle
of Man</i> (2 vols. 8vo, with an atlas of plates in 4to), which forms
one of the classical treatises on British geology. He was elected
F.R.S. in 1820. He continued to write papers, chiefly on the
rocks and minerals of Scotland, and had at last gathered so
large an amount of information that the government was prevailed
upon in the year 1826 to employ him in the preparation
of a geological map of Scotland. From that date up to the time
of his death he returned each summer to Scotland and traversed
every district of the kingdom, inserting the geological features
upon Arrowsmith&rsquo;s map, the only one then available for his
purpose. He completed the field-work in 1832, and in 1834 his
map and memoir were ready for publication, but these were not
issued until 1836, the year after he died. Among his other
works the following may be mentioned: <i>A Geological Classification
of Rocks with Descriptive Synopses of the Species and
Varieties, comprising the Elements of Practical Geology</i> (1821);
<i>The Highlands and Western Isles of Scotland</i>, in a series of letters
to Sir Walter Scott (4 vols. 1824); <i>A System of Geology, with a
Theory of the Earth and an Examination of its Connexion with the
Sacred Records</i> (2 vols. 1831). During a visit to Cornwall he
was killed by being dragged along in the wheel of his carriage,
on the 21st of August 1835.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In penning an obituary notice, C. Lyell in 1836 (<i>Proc. Geol. Soc.</i>
ii. 357) acknowledged &ldquo;with gratitude&rdquo; that he had &ldquo;received
more instruction from Macculloch&rsquo;s labours in geology than from
those of any living writer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">M&lsquo;CULLOCH, JOHN RAMSAY<a name="ar147" id="ar147"></a></span> (1789-1864), British economist
and statistician, was born on the 1st of March 1789 at Whithorn
in Wigtownshire. His family belonged to the class of &ldquo;statesmen,&rdquo;
or small landed proprietors. He was for some time
employed at Edinburgh as a clerk in the office of a writer to
the signet. But, the <i>Scotsman</i> newspaper having been established
at the beginning of 1817, M&lsquo;Culloch sent a contribution
to the fourth number, the merit of which was at once recognized;
he soon became connected with the management of the paper,
and during 1818 and 1819 acted as editor. Most of his articles
related to questions of political economy, and he delivered
lectures in Edinburgh on that science. He now also began to
write on subjects of the same class in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span>
his first contribution being an article on Ricardo&rsquo;s <i>Principles
of Political Economy</i> in 1818. Within the next few years he
gave both public lectures and private instruction in London
on political economy. In 1823 he was chosen to fill the lectureship
established by subscription in honour of the memory of
Ricardo. A movement was set on foot in 1825 by Jeffrey and
others to induce the government to found in the university of
Edinburgh a chair of political economy, separate from that of
moral philosophy, the intention being to obtain the appointment
for M&lsquo;Culloch. This project fell to the ground; but in 1828 he
was made professor of political economy in London University.
He then fixed his residence permanently in London, where he
continued his literary work, being now one of the regular writers
in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. In 1838 he was appointed comptroller
of the stationery office; the duties of this position, which he
held till his death, he discharged with conscientious fidelity,
and introduced important reforms in the management of the
department. Sir Robert Peel, in recognition of the services he
had rendered to political science, conferred on him a literary
pension of £200 per annum. He was elected a foreign associate
of the Institute of France (<i>Académie des sciences morales et
politiques</i>). He died in London, after a short illness, on the 11th
of November 1864, in the seventy-sixth year of his age. To
his personal character and social qualities very favourable
testimony was borne by those who knew him best. In general
politics he always remained a Whig pure and simple; though he
was in intimate relations with James Mill and his circle, he
never shared the Radical opinions of that group.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>M&lsquo;Culloch cannot be regarded as an original thinker on political
economy. He did not contribute any new ideas to that science, or
introduce any noteworthy correction of the views, either as to
method or doctrine, generally accepted by the dominant school of
his day. But the work he did must be pronounced, in relation to
the wants of his time, a very valuable one. His name will probably
be less permanently associated with anything he has written on
economic science, strictly so called, than with his great statistical
and other compilations. His <i>Dictionary of Commerce and Commercial
Navigation</i> (1832) and his <i>Statistical Account of the British Empire</i>
(1837) remain imposing monuments of his extensive and varied
knowledge and his indefatigable industry. Another useful work
of reference, also the fruit of wide erudition and much labour, is his
<i>Literature of Political Economy</i> (1845). Though weak on the side
of the foreign literature of the science, it is very valuable as a
critical and biographical guide to British writers.</p>

was born at Greenock, the son of a shipowner, and was
educated at the Royal College of Music. His first success was
with the overture <i>Land of the Mountain and Flood</i> in 1887 at
the Crystal Palace, and this was followed by other compositions,
with a characteristic Scottish colouring. From 1888 to
1894 he was a professor at the Royal College of Music, and this
latter year saw both his marriage to a daughter of John Pettie,
R.A., and the production of his opera <i>Jeanie Deans</i> at Edinburgh.
He was for some years conductor to the Carl Rosa
Opera company, and subsequently to other companies. His
opera <i>Diarmid</i> was produced at Covent Garden in 1897, and his
other music includes cantatas, overtures, part-songs, instrumental
pieces, and songs, all markedly Scottish in type.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACDONALD, FLORA<a name="ar150" id="ar150"></a></span> (1722-1790), Jacobite heroine, was
the daughter of Ranald Macdonald of Milton in the island of
South Uist in the Hebrides, and his wife Marion the daughter
of Angus Macdonald, minister of South Uist. Her father died
when she was a child, and her mother was abducted and
married by Hugh Macdonald of Armadale. She was brought
up under the care of the chief of her clan, Macdonald of
Clanranald, and was partly educated in Edinburgh. In June
1746 she was living in Benbecula in the Hebrides when
Prince Charles Edward (<i>q.v.</i>) took refuge there after the
battle of Culloden. The prince&rsquo;s companion, Captain O&rsquo;Neill,
sought her help. The island was held for the government by
the local militia, but the secret sympathies of the Macdonalds
were with the Jacobite cause. After some hesitation Flora
promised to help. At a later period she told the duke of Cumberland,
son of George III. and commander-in-chief in
Scotland, that she acted from charity and would have helped
him also if he had been defeated and in distress, a statement
which need not be accepted as quite literally true. The
commander of the militia in the island, a Macdonald, who was
probably admitted into the secret, gave her a pass to the mainland
for herself, a manservant, an Irish spinning maid, Betty
Burke, and a boat&rsquo;s crew of six men. The prince was disguised
as Betty Burke. After a first repulse at Waternish, the party
landed at Portree. The prince was hidden in a cave while
Flora Macdonald found help for him in the neighbourhood, and
was finally able to escape. He had left Benbecula on the 27th of
June. The talk of the boatmen brought suspicion on Flora
Macdonald, and she was arrested and brought to London.
After a short imprisonment in the Tower, she was allowed to
live outside of it, under the guard of a &ldquo;messenger&rdquo; or gaoler.
When the Act of Indemnity was passed in 1747 she was left at
liberty. Her courage and loyalty had gained her general
sympathy, which was increased by her good manners and gentle
character. Dr Johnson, who saw her in 1773, describes her as
&ldquo;a woman of soft features, gentle manners and elegant presence.&rdquo;
In 1750 she married Allen Macdonald of Kingsburgh,
and in 1773 they emigrated to America. In the War of Independence
he served the British government and was taken
prisoner. In 1779 his wife returned home in a merchant ship
which was attacked by a privateer. She refused to leave the
deck during the action, and was wounded in the arm. She died
on the 5th of March 1790. There is a statue to her memory
in Inverness. Flora Macdonald had a large family of sons,
who mostly entered the army or navy, and two daughters.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACDONALD, GEORGE<a name="ar151" id="ar151"></a></span> (1824-1905), Scottish novelist and
poet, was born at Huntly, Aberdeenshire. His father, a farmer,
was one of the Macdonalds of Glencoe, and a direct descendant
of one of the families that suffered in the massacre.
Macdonald&rsquo;s youth was passed in his native town, under the
immediate influence of the Congregational Church, and in an
atmosphere strongly impregnated with Calvinism. He took
his degree at Aberdeen University, and migrated thence to
London, studying at Highbury College for the Congregational
ministry. In 1850 he was appointed pastor of Trinity Congregational
Church, Arundel, and, after resigning his cure there,
was engaged in ministerial work in Manchester. His health,
however, was unequal to the strain, and after a short sojourn
in Algiers he settled in London and adopted the profession of
literature. In 1856 he published his first book, <i>Within and
Without</i>, a dramatic poem; following it in 1857 with a volume
of <i>Poems</i>, and in 1858 by the delightful &ldquo;faerie romance&rdquo;
<i>Phantastes</i>. His first conspicuous success was achieved in 1862
with <i>David Elginbrod</i>, the forerunner of a number of popular
novels, which include <i>Alec Forbes of Howglen</i> (1865), <i>Annals
of a Quiet Neighbourhood</i> (1866), <i>Robert Falconer</i> (1868), <i>Malcolm</i>
(1875), <i>The Marquis of Lossie</i> (1877), and <i>Donal Grant</i> (1883).
He was for a time editor of <i>Good Words for the Young</i>, and lectured
successfully in America in 1872-1873. He wrote admirable
stories for the young, and published some volumes of sermons.
In 1877 he was given a civil list pension. He died on the 18th
of September 1905.</p>

<p>Both as preacher and as lecturer on literary topics George
Macdonald&rsquo;s sincerity and moral enthusiasm exercised great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>210</span>
influence upon thoughtful minds. His verse is homely and
direct, and marked by religious fervour and simplicity. As a
portrayer of Scottish peasant-life in fiction he was the precursor
of a large school, which has benefited by his example and surpassed
its original leader in popularity. The religious tone of
his novels is relieved by tolerance and a broad spirit of humour,
and the simpler emotions of humble life are sympathetically
treated.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACDONALD, SIR HECTOR ARCHIBALD<a name="ar152" id="ar152"></a></span> (1852-1903),
British soldier, was born of humble parentage at Muir of Allan-Grange,
Ross-shire, Scotland, in 1852. As a boy he was employed
in a draper&rsquo;s shop at Dingwall, but in 1870 he enlisted in the
92nd (Gordon) Highlanders. He rose rapidly through the non-commissioned
ranks, and had already been a colour-sergeant
for some years when, in the Afghan War of 1879, he distinguished
himself in the presence of the enemy so much as
to be promoted to commissioned rank, his advancement being
equally acceptable to his brother officers and popular with the
rank and file. As a subaltern he served in the first Boer War
of 1880-81, and at Majuba, where he was made prisoner, his
bravery was so conspicuous that General Joubert gave him
back his sword. In 1885 he served under Sir Evelyn Wood
in the reorganization of the Egyptian army, and he took part
in the Nile Expedition of that year. In 1888 he became a
regimental captain in the British service, but continued to
serve in the Egyptian army, being particularly occupied with
the training of the Sudanese battalions. In 1889 he received
the D.S.O. for his conduct at Toski and in 1891, after the
action at Tokar, he was promoted substantive major. In
1896 he commanded a brigade of the Egyptian army in the
Dongola Expedition, and during the following campaigns he
distinguished himself in every engagement, above all in the
final battle of Omdurman (1898) at the crisis of which Macdonald&rsquo;s
Sudanese brigade, man&oelig;uvring as a unit with the
coolness and precision of the parade ground, repulsed the most
determined attack of the Mahdists. After this great service
Macdonald&rsquo;s name became famous in England and Scotland,
the popular sobriquet of &ldquo;Fighting Mac&rdquo; testifying the
interest aroused in the public mind by his career and his soldierly
personality. He was promoted colonel in the army and appointed
an aide-de-camp to the queen, and in 1899 he was
promoted major-general and appointed to a command in India.
In December 1899 he was called to South Africa to command the
Highland Brigade, which had just suffered very heavily and had
lost its commander, Major-General A. G. Wauchope, in the
battle of Magersfontein. He commanded the brigade throughout
Lord Roberts&rsquo;s Paardeberg, Bloemfontein and Pretoria
operations, and in 1901 he was made a K.C.B. In 1902 he
was appointed to command the troops in Ceylon, but early in
the following year (March 25, 1903) he committed suicide
in Paris. A memorial to this brilliant soldier, in the form of
a tower 100 ft. high, was erected at Dingwall and completed
in 1907.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACDONALD, JACQUES ÉTIENNE JOSEPH ALEXANDRE<a name="ar153" id="ar153"></a></span>
(1765-1840), duke of Taranto and marshal of France, was born
at Sedan on the 17th of November 1765. His father came of an
old Jacobite family, which had followed James II. to France,
and was a near relative of the celebrated Flora Macdonald.
In 1785 Macdonald joined the legion raised to support the
revolutionary party in Holland against the Prussians, and
after it was disbanded he received a commission in the regiment
of Dillon. On the breaking out of the Revolution, the regiment
of Dillon remained eminently loyal, with the exception of
Macdonald, who was in love with Mlle Jacob, whose father
was enthusiastic for the doctrines of the Revolution. Directly
after his marriage he was appointed aide-de-camp to General
Dumouriez. He distinguished himself at Jemmapes, and was
promoted colonel in 1793. He refused to desert to the Austrians
with Dumouriez, and as a reward was made general of brigade,
and appointed to command the leading brigade in Pichegru&rsquo;s
invasion of Holland. His knowledge of the country proved
most useful, and he was instrumental in the capture of the
Dutch fleet by French hussars. In 1797, having been made
general of division, he served first in the army of the Rhine and
then in that of Italy. When he reached Italy, the peace of
Campo Formio had been signed, and Bonaparte had returned
to France; but, under the direction of Berthier, Macdonald
first occupied Rome, of which he was made governor, and then
in conjunction with Championnet he defeated General Mack,
and revolutionized the kingdom of Naples under the title of the
Parthenopaean Republic. When Suvarov invaded northern Italy,
and was winning back the conquests of Bonaparte, Macdonald
collected all the troops in the peninsula and moved northwards.
With but 30,000 men he attacked, at the Trebbia, Suvarov with
50,000, and after three days&rsquo; fighting, during which he held
the Russians at bay, and gave time for Moreau to come up,
he retired in good order to Genoa. After this gallant behaviour
he was made governor of Versailles, and acquiesced, if he did
not co-operate, in the events of the 18th Brumaire. In 1800
he received the command of the army in Switzerland which
was to maintain the communications between the armies of
Germany and of Italy. He carried out his orders to the letter,
and at last, in the winter of 1800-1, he was ordered to march
over the Splügen Pass. This achievement is fully described
by Mathieu Dumas, who was chief of his staff, and is at least
as noteworthy as Bonaparte&rsquo;s famous passage of the St Bernard
before Marengo, though followed by no such successful battle.
On his return to Paris Macdonald married the widow of
General Joubert, and was appointed French plenipotentiary in
Denmark. Returning in 1805 he associated himself with Moreau
and incurred the dislike of Napoleon, who did not include him
in his first creation of marshals. Till 1809 he remained without
employment, but in that year Napoleon gave him the command
of a corps and the duties of military adviser to the young prince
Eugène Beauharnais, viceroy of Italy. He led the army from
Italy till its junction with Napoleon, and at Wagram commanded
the celebrated column of attack which broke the Austrian centre
and won the victory. Napoleon made him marshal of France
on the field of battle, and presently created him duke of Taranto.
In 1810 he served in Spain, and in 1812 he commanded the left
wing of the grand army for the invasion of Russia. In 1813,
after sharing in the battles of Lützen and Bautzen, he was
ordered to invade Silesia, where Blücher defeated him with
great loss at the Katzbach (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Napoleonic Campaigns</a></span>). After
the terrible battle of Leipzig he was ordered with Prince Poniatowski
to cover the evacuation of Leipzig; after the blowing
up of the bridge, he managed to swim the Elster, while Poniatowski
was drowned. During the defensive campaign of 1814
Macdonald again distinguished himself; he was one of the
marshals sent by Napoleon to take his abdication in favour
of his son to Paris. When all were deserting their old master,
Macdonald remained faithful to him. He was directed by
Napoleon to give in his adherence to the new régime, and was
presented by him with the sabre of Murad Bey for his fidelity.
At the Restoration he was made a peer of France and knight
grand cross of the order of St Louis; he remained faithful to
the new order of things during the Hundred Days. In 1815
he became chancellor of the Legion of Honour (a post he held
till 1831), in 1816 major-general of the royal bodyguard, and he
took a great part in the discussions in the House of Peers, voting
consistently as a moderate Liberal. In 1823 he married Mlle
de Bourgony, by whom he had a son, Alexander, who succeeded
on his death in 1840 as duke of Taranto. From 1830 his
life was spent in retirement at his country place Courcelles-le-Roi
(Seine et Oise), where he died on the 7th of September
1840.</p>

<p>Macdonald had none of that military genius which distinguished
Davout, Masséna and Lannes, nor of that military
science conspicuous in Marmont and St Cyr, but nevertheless
his campaign in Switzerland gives him a rank far superior to
such mere generals of division as Oudinot and Dupont. This
capacity for independent command made Napoleon, in spite
of his defeats at the Trebbia and the Katzbach, trust him
with large commands till the end of his career. As a man, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>211</span>
character cannot be spoken of too highly; no stain of cruelty
or faithlessness rests on him.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Macdonald was especially fortunate in the accounts of his military
exploits, Mathieu Dumas and Ségur having been on his staff in
Switzerland. See Dumas, <i>Événements militaires</i>; and Ségur&rsquo;s rare
tract, <i>Lettre sur la campagne du Général Macdonald dans les Grisons
en 1800 et 1801</i> (1802), and <i>Éloge</i> (1842). His memoirs were published
in 1892 (Eng. trans., <i>Recollections of Marshal Macdonald</i>),
but are brief and wanting in balance.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACDONALD, SIR JOHN ALEXANDER<a name="ar154" id="ar154"></a></span> (1815-1891), first
premier of the dominion of Canada, was born in Glasgow on the
11th of January 1815, the third child of Hugh Macdonald
(d. 1841), a native of Sutherlandshire. The family emigrated
to Canada in 1820, settling first at Kingston, Ontario. At the
age of fifteen Macdonald entered a law office; he was called to
the bar in 1836, and began practice in Kingston, with immediate
success. Macdonald entered upon his active career at a critical
period in the history of Canada, and the circumstances of the time
were calculated to stimulate political thought. It was the year
before the rebellion of 1837; the condition of the whole country
was very unsettled; and it seemed well-nigh impossible to reconcile
differences arising from racial and political antagonisms.
During the rebellion young Macdonald volunteered for active
service, but his military career never went farther than drilling
and marching. The mission of Lord Durham; the publication
of his famous report; the union of the two Canadas; the administrations
of Lord Sydenham, Sir Charles Bagot, and Sir
Charles Metcalfe, filled the years immediately succeeding 1837
with intense political interest, and in their results have profoundly
influenced the constitution of the British Empire.</p>

<p>Macdonald made his first acquaintance with public business
as an alderman of Kingston. In 1844 Sir Charles Metcalfe, in
his contest with the Reform party led by Baldwin and
Lafontaine, appealed to the electors, and Macdonald was elected
to the provincial assembly as Conservative member for Kingston.
A sentence in his first address to the electors strikes the dominant
note of his public career: &ldquo;I therefore need scarcely
state my firm belief that the prosperity of Canada depends upon
its permanent connexion with the mother country, and that I
shall resist to the utmost any attempt (from whatever quarter
it may come) which may tend to weaken that union.&rdquo; He took
his seat on the 28th of November as a supporter of the Draper
government. During the first three or four years he spoke
little, but devoted himself with assiduity to mastering parliamentary
forms and the business of the house. His capacity
soon attracted attention, and in 1847 he was made receiver-general
with a seat in the executive council, an office soon
exchanged for the more important one of commissioner of
Crown-lands. Although the government of which he thus
became a member held office for only ten months, being placed
in a hopeless minority on making an appeal to the country,
Macdonald from this time forward took a position of constantly
increasing weight in his party.</p>

<p>One of the first acts of the Reform government which succeeded
that of which Macdonald was a member was to pass the Rebellion
Losses Bill, made famous in colonial history by the fact that it
brought to a crucial test the principle of responsible government.
The assent of Lord Elgin to the bill provoked in Montreal a riot
which ended in the burning of the houses of parliament, and so
great was the indignation of the hitherto ultra-loyal Conservative
party that many of its most prominent members signed
a document favouring annexation to the United States; Macdonald
on the other hand took steps, in conjunction with others,
to form a British-American league, having for its object the
confederation of all the provinces, the strengthening of the
connexion with the mother country, and the adoption of a
national commercial policy. He remained in opposition from
1848 till 1854, holding together under difficult circumstances an
unpopular party with which he was not entirely in sympathy.
The two great political issues of the time were the secularization
of the clergy reserves in Ontario, and the abolition of seigniorial
tenure in Quebec. Both of these reforms Macdonald long opposed,
but when successive elections had proved that they were supported
by public opinion, he brought about a coalition of Conservatives
and moderate reformers for the purpose of carrying them.</p>

<p>Out of this coalition was gradually developed the Liberal-conservative
party, of which until his death Macdonald continued
to be the most considerable figure, and which for more
than forty years largely moulded the history of Canada. From
1854 to 1857 he was attorney-general of Upper Canada, and
then, on the retirement of Colonel Taché, he became prime
minister. This first coalition had now accomplished its temporary
purpose, but so closely were parties divided at this period,
that the defeat and reinstatement of governments followed
each other in rapid succession.</p>

<p>The experiment of applying responsible government on party
lines to the two Canadian provinces at last seemed to have come
to a deadlock. Two general elections and the defeat of four
ministries within three years had done nothing to solve the
difficulties of the situation. At this critical period a proposal
was made for a coalition of parties in order to carry out a
broad scheme of British-American confederation. The immediate
proposal is said to have come from George Brown;
the large political idea had long been advocated by Macdonald
and Alexander Galt in Upper Canada&mdash;by Joseph Howe and
others in the maritime provinces. The close of the American
Civil War, the Fenian raids across the American border, and
the dangers incident to the international situation, gave a decisive
impulse to the movement. Macdonald, at the head of
a representative delegation from Ontario and Quebec, met the
public men of the maritime provinces in conference at Charlottetown
in 1864, and the outline of confederation then agreed
upon was filled out in detail at a conference held at Quebec soon
afterwards. The actual framing of the British North America
Act, into which the resolutions of these two conferences were
consolidated, was carried out at the Westminster Palace Hotel
in London, during December 1866 and January 1867, by delegates
from all the provinces working in co-operation with the
law officers of the Crown, under the presidency of Lord
Carnarvon, then secretary of state for the colonies. Macdonald
took the leading part in all these discussions, and he thus
naturally became the first premier of the Dominion. He was
made a K.C.B. in recognition of his services to the empire.</p>

<p>The difficulties of organizing the new Dominion, the questions
arising from diverse claims and the various conditions of the
country, called for infinite tact and resource on the part of the
premier. Federal rights were to be safeguarded against the
provincial governments, always jealous of their privileges.
The people of Nova Scotia in particular, dissatisfied with the
way in which their province had been drawn into the Union,
maintained a fierce opposition to the Ottawa government,
until their leader, Joseph Howe, fearing an armed rising, came
to an agreement with Macdonald and accepted a seat in his
cabinet. The establishment of a supreme court also occupied
the attention of Sir John, who had a strong sense of the necessity
of maintaining the purity and dignity of the judicial office.
The act creating this court was finally passed during the
administration of Alexander Mackenzie. The pledge made at
confederation with regard to the building of the Intercolonial
railway to connect the maritime provinces with those of the
St Lawrence was fulfilled. The North-West Territories were
secured as a part of confederated Canada by the purchase of
the rights of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company, and the establishment
of Manitoba as a province in 1870. Canada&rsquo;s interests were
protected during the negotiations which ended in the treaty
of Washington in 1871, and in which Sir John took a leading
part as one of the British delegates. In this year British
Columbia entered the confederation, one of the provisions of
union being that a transcontinental railroad should be built
within ten years. This was declared by the opposition to be
impossible. It was possible only to a leader of indomitable
will. Charges of bribery against the government in connexion
with the contract for the building of this line led to the resignation
of the cabinet in 1874, and for four years Sir John
was in opposition. But he was by no means inactive. During
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span>
the summer of 1876 he travelled through Ontario addressing the
people on the subject of a commercial system looking to the
protection of native industries. This was the celebrated
&ldquo;National Policy,&rdquo; which had been in his thoughts as long ago
as the formation of the British-American League in 1850. The
government of Alexander Mackenzie refused to consider a
protection policy, and determined to adhere to Free Trade,
with a tariff for revenue only. On these strongly defined
issues the two parties appealed to the people in 1878. The
Liberal party was almost swept away, and Sir John, on his
return to power, put his policy into effect with a thoroughness
that commanded the admiration even of his opponents, who,
after long resistance, adopted it on their accession to office in
1896. He also undertook the immediate construction of the
Canadian Pacific railway, which had been postponed by the
former government. The line was begun late in 1880, and
finished in November 1885&mdash;an achievement which Sir John
ranked among his greatest triumphs. &ldquo;The faith of Sir John,&rdquo;
says one of his biographers, &ldquo;did more to build the road than
the money of Mount-Stephen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the remaining years of his life his efforts at administration
were directed mainly towards the organization and
development of the great North-West. From 1878 until his
death in 1891 Sir John retained his position as premier of
Canada, and his history is practically that of Canada (<i>q.v.</i>).
For forty-six years of a stormy political life he remained true
to the cardinal policy that he had announced to the electors
of Kingston in 1844. &ldquo;A British subject I was born; a British
subject I will die,&rdquo; says his last political manifesto to the people
of the Dominion. At his advanced age the anxiety and excitement
of the contested election of 1891 proved too great. On
the 29th of May he suffered a stroke of paralysis, which caused
his death eight days later (June 6).</p>

<p>The career of Sir John Macdonald must be considered in
connexion with the political history of Canada and the conditions
of its government during the latter half of the 19th
century. Trained in a school where the principles of responsible
government were still in an embryonic state, where the adroit
management of coalitions and cabals was essential to the life
of a political party, and where plots and counterplots were
looked upon as a regular part of the political game, he acquired
a dexterity and skill in managing men that finally gave him
an almost autocratic power among his political followers. But
great personal qualities supplemented his political dexterity
and sagacity. A strong will enabled him to overcome the
passionate temper which marked his youth, and later in his
career a habit of intemperance, which he at first shared with
many public men of his time. He was a man of strong ambitions,
but these were curbed by a shrewd foresight, which led
him for a long time to submit to the nominal leadership of
other and smaller men. Politics he made his business, and
to this he devoted all his energies. He had the gift of living
for the work in hand without feeling the distraction of other
interests. He had a singular faculty for reading the minds and
the motives of men, and to this insight he perhaps owed the
power of adaptability (called by his opponents shiftiness) which
characterized his whole career. To this power the successful
guidance of the Dominion through its critical formative period
must be ascribed. Few political leaders have ever had such
a number of antagonistic elements to reconcile as presented
themselves in the first Canadian parliament after confederation.
The man who could manage to rule a congeries of jealous
factions, including Irish Catholics and Orangemen, French and
English anti-federationists and agitators for independence,
Conservatives and Reformers, careful economists and prodigal
expansionists, was manifestly a man of unusual power, superior
to small prejudices, and without strong bias towards any creed
or section. Such a man Macdonald proved himself to be. His
personality stands out at this period as the central power in
which each faction chiefly reposed trust, and under which it
could join hands with the others in the service of the state.
His singleness of purpose, personal independence and indomitable
energy enabled him to achieve triumphs that to others
seemed impossible. His methods cannot always be defended,
and were explained by himself only on grounds of necessity
and the character of the electorate with which he had to deal.
After the &ldquo;Pacific scandal&rdquo; of 1874 the leader of the opposite
party declared that &ldquo;John A.&rdquo; (as he was generally called)
&ldquo;has fallen, never to rise again.&rdquo; Yet he not only cleared his
own character from the charges laid against him, but succeeded
four years later in achieving his most signal party triumph.
His natural urbanity allowed him to rule without seeming to
rule. When baffled in minor objects he gave way with a good-natured
flexibility which brought upon him at times charges of
inconsistency. Yet Canada has seen statesmen of more contracted
view insist on such small points, fall, and drag down
their party with them. He lived at a time when the exigencies
of state seemed to require the peculiar talents which he possessed.
Entering politics at the dreariest and least profitable stage in
Canadian history, he took the foremost part in the movement
which made of Canada a nation; he guided that nation through
the nebulous stages of its existence, and left it united, strong
and vigorous, a monument to his patriotic and far-sighted
statesmanship. His statue adorns the squares of the principal
Canadian towns. In the crypt of St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral a memorial
has rightly been placed to him as a statesman, not merely
of Canada, but of the empire. In unveiling that memorial
Lord Rosebery fitly epitomized the meaning of his life and work
when he said: &ldquo;We recognize only this, that Sir John Macdonald
had grasped the central idea that the British Empire
is the greatest secular agency for good now known to mankind;
that that was the secret of his success; and that he determined
to die under it, and strove that Canada should live under it.&rdquo;
Macdonald became a member of the Imperial Privy Council in
1879, and in 1884 he received the Grand Cross of the Bath.
His first wife was his cousin, Miss Isabella Clark, who died in
1858, leaving one surviving son, the Hon. Hugh John Macdonald,
at one time premier of the province of Manitoba. By
his second marriage, to Miss Bernard in 1867, Macdonald left
an only daughter. On his death in 1891 his widow was created
Baroness Macdonald of Earnscliffe.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACDONALD, JOHN SANDFIELD<a name="ar155" id="ar155"></a></span> (1812-1872), Canadian
statesman, was born at St Raphael, Glengarry county, Ontario,
on the 12th of December 1812. He was admitted to the bar
in 1840, and settled in Cornwall. In the same year he married
Miss Waggaman, the daughter of an American senator from
Louisiana. In 1841 he was elected to the Canadian parliament
for Glengarry, which seat he held for sixteen years. In 1842 he
joined the Reformers in the cry for constitutional government,
and from 1852 to 1854 was Speaker of the house. He was
always uncertain in his party allegiance, and often attacked
George Brown, the Liberal leader. Indeed, he well described
himself as &ldquo;the Ishmael of parliament.&rdquo; In 1862 he was
called on by Lord Monck, the governor-general, to form a
ministry, which by manifold shifts held office till February
1864. In the debates on federation he opposed the measure,
but on its passage was in 1867 entrusted by the Conservatives
with the task of organizing the provincial government of Ontario.
He ruled the province with economy and efficiency, but was
defeated in December 1871 by the Liberals, resigned the premiership,
and died on the 1st of June 1872.</p>

<span class="bold">RUADH</span> (<i>c.</i> 1725-1761), chief of Glengarry, a Scottish Jacobite
who has been identified by Andrew Lang as the secret agent
&ldquo;Pickle,&rdquo; who acted as a spy on Prince Charles Edward after
1750. The family were a branch of the clan Macdonald, but
spelt their name Macdonnell or Macdonell. His father was
John, 12th chief of Glengarry, a violent and brutal man, who
is said to have starved his first wife, Alestair&rsquo;s mother, to
death on an island in the Hebrides. Alestair ran away to
France while a mere boy in 1738, and there entered the Royal
Scots, a regiment in the French service. In 1743 he commanded
a company in it, and in 1744 was sent to Scotland as a Jacobite
agent. In January 1745 he was sent back with messages,
and was in France when Prince Charles Edward landed in
Scotland. Late in 1745 he was captured at sea while bringing
a picquet of the Royal Scots to help the prince. He remained
a prisoner in the Tower for twenty-two months, and when
released went abroad. In 1744 his father had made a transfer
to him of the family estates, which were ruined. Alestair,
who still affected to be a Jacobite, lived for a time in great
poverty. In 1749 he was in London, and there is good reason
to believe that he then offered his services as a spy to the British
government, with which he communicated under the name
of Pickle. His information enabled British ministers to keep
a close watch on the prince and on the Jacobite conspiracies.
Though he was denounced by a Mrs Cameron, whose husband
he betrayed to death in 1752, he never lost the confidence of
the Jacobite leaders. On the death of his father, in 1754, he
succeeded to the estates, and proved himself a greedy landlord.
He died on the 23rd of December 1761.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACDONNELL, SORLEY BOY<a name="ar159" id="ar159"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1505-1590), Scoto-Irish
chieftain, son of Alexander Macdonnell, lord of Islay and
Kintyre (Cantire), was born at Ballycastle, Co. Antrim. From
an ancestor who about a hundred years earlier had married
Margaret Bisset, heiress of the district on the Antrim coast
known as the Glynns (or Glens), he inherited a claim to the
lordship of that territory; and he was one of the most powerful
of the Scottish settlers in Ulster whom the English government
in the 16th century found difficulty in bringing into subjection.
Many attempts were made to drive them out of Ireland, in
one of which, about 1550, Sorley Boy Macdonnell was taken
prisoner and conveyed to Dublin Castle, where, however,
his confinement was brief. The chief rivals of the Macdonnells
were the Mac Quillins who dominated the northern portion
of Antrim, known as the Route, and whose stronghold was
Dunluce Castle, near the mouth of the Bush. Sorley Boy
Macdonnell took an active part in the tribal warfare between
his own clan and the Mac Quillins; and in 1558, when the
latter had been to a great extent overcome, his elder brother
James committed to him the lordship of the Route, his hold
on which he made good by decisively defeating the Mac Quillins
in Glenshesk. Sorley Boy was now too powerful and turbulent
to be neglected by Queen Elizabeth and her ministers, who
were also being troubled by his great contemporary, Shane
O&rsquo;Neill; and the history of Ulster for the next twenty years
consists for the most part of alternating conflict and alliance
between Macdonnells and O&rsquo;Neills, and attempts on the part
of the English government to subdue them both. With this
object Elizabeth aimed at fomenting the rivalry between the
two clans; and she came to terms sometimes with the one and
sometimes with the other. Sorley Boy&rsquo;s wife was an illegitimate
half-sister of Shane O&rsquo;Neill; but this did not deter him
from leaguing himself with the government against the O&rsquo;Neills,
if by so doing he could obtain a formal recognition of his title
to the lands of which he was in actual possession. In 1562
Shane O&rsquo;Neill paid his celebrated visit to London, where he
obtained recognition by Elizabeth of his claims as head of
the O&rsquo;Neills; and on his return to Ireland he attacked the
Macdonnells, ostensibly in the English interest. He defeated
Sorley Boy near Coleraine in the summer of 1564; in 1565 he
invaded the Glynns, and at Ballycastle won a decisive victory,
in which James Macdonnell and Sorley Boy were taken prisoners.
James soon afterwards died, but Sorley Boy remained O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s
captive till 1567, when Shane was murdered by the Macdonnells
at Cushendun (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">O&rsquo;Neill</a></span>). Sorley Boy then went to Scotland
to enlist support, and he spent the next few years in striving
to frustrate the schemes of Sir Thomas Smith, and later of
the earl of Essex, for colonizing Ulster with English settlers.
Sorley Boy was willing to come to terms with the government
provided his claims to his lands were allowed, but Essex
determined to reduce him to unconditional submission. John
Norris was ordered to proceed by sea from Carrickfergus to
Rathlin Island, where Sorley Boy&rsquo;s children and valuables,
together with the families of his principal retainers, had been
lodged for safety; and while the chieftain was himself at Ballycastle,
within sight of the island, the women and children were
massacred by the English. Sorley Boy retaliated by a successful
raid on Carrickfergus and by re-establishing his power
in the Glynns and the Route, which the Mac Quillins made
ineffectual attempts to recover. Macdonnell&rsquo;s position was
still further strengthened by an alliance with Turlough Luineach
O&rsquo;Neill, and by a formidable immigration of followers from the
Scottish islands. In 1584 Sir John Perrot determined to
make a further effort to subdue the turbulent chieftain. After
another expedition to Scotland seeking help, Sorley Boy landed
at Cushendun in January 1585, and his followers regained
possession of Dunluce Castle. In these circumstances Sir
John Perrot opened negotiations with Sorley Boy, who in the
summer of 1586 repaired to Dublin and made submission to
Elizabeth&rsquo;s representative. He obtained a grant to himself
and his heirs of all the Route country between the rivers Bann
and Bush, with certain other lands to the east, and was made
constable of Dunluce Castle, For the rest of his life Sorley
Boy gave no trouble to the English government. He died in
1590, and was buried in Bonamairgy Abbey, at Ballycastle.
He is said to have married when over eighty years of age, as
his second wife, a daughter of Turlough Luineach O&rsquo;Neill, a
kinswoman of his first wife; and two of his five daughters
married members of the O&rsquo;Neill family. Sorley Boy had
several sons by his first marriage, one of whom, Randal, was
created earl of Antrim (<i>q.v.</i>), and was ancestor of the present
holder of that title.</p>

in 1800. During his long service as a lieutenant he took part

an alleged deserter from the British navy, his ship at the time
lying under the guns of Gibraltar. When war with England
broke out, in 1812, he was ordered to cruise in the lakes between
Canada and the United States, with his headquarters on lake
Champlain. He was instrumental in saving New York and
Vermont from invasion by his brilliant victory of lake Champlain
gained, on the 11th of September 1814, with a flotilla
of 14 vessels carrying 86 guns, over Captain George Downie&rsquo;s

<p><span class="bold">MacDOWELL, EDWARD ALEXANDER<a name="ar161" id="ar161"></a></span> (1861-1908), American
musical composer, was born in New York City on the
18th of December 1861. His father, an Irishman of Belfast,
had emigrated to America shortly before the boy&rsquo;s birth. He
had a varied education in music, first under Spanish-American
teachers, and then in Europe, at Paris (Debussy being a fellow
pupil), Stuttgart, Wiesbaden and Weimar, where he was chiefly
influenced by Joachim, Raff and Liszt. From 1879 to 1887
he lived in Germany, teaching and studying, and also appearing
as solo pianist at important concerts. In 1884 he married
Marian Nevins, of New York. In 1888 he returned to America,
and settled in Boston till in 1896 he was made professor of
music at Columbia University, New York. He resigned this
post in 1904, and in 1905 overwork and insomnia resulted in
a complete cerebral collapse. He died on the 24th of January
1908. MacDowell&rsquo;s work gives him perhaps the highest place
among American composers. Deeply influenced by modern
French models and by German romanticism, full of poetry
and &ldquo;atmosphere,&rdquo; and founded on the &ldquo;programme,&rdquo; idea of
composition, it is essentially creative in the spirit of a searcher
after delicate truths of artistic expression. His employment
of touches of American folk-song, suggested by Indian themes,
is characteristic. This is notably the case with his orchestral
<i>Indian Suite</i> (1896) and <i>Woodland Sketches</i> for the piano.
His first concerto, in A minor, for piano and orchestra, and
first pianoforte suite, were performed at Weimar in 1882.
His works include orchestral suites and &ldquo;poems,&rdquo; songs,
choruses, and various pieces for pianoforte, his own instrument;
they are numbered from <i>op.</i> 9 to <i>op.</i> 62, his first eight numbered
works being destroyed by him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">McDOWELL, IRVIN<a name="ar162" id="ar162"></a></span> (1818-1885), American soldier, was
born in Columbus, Ohio, on the 15th of October 1818. He
was educated in France, and graduated at the U. S. military
academy in 1838. From 1841 to 1845 he was instructor, and
later adjutant, at West Point. He won the brevet of captain
in the Mexican War, at the battle of Buena Vista, and served
as adjutant-general, chiefly at Washington, until 1861, being promoted
major in 1856. In 1858-1859 he visited Europe. Whilst
occupied in mustering volunteers at the capital, he was made
brigadier-general in May 1861, and placed in command during
the premature Virginian campaign of July, which ended in
the defeat at Bull Run. Under McClellan he became a corps
commander and major-general of volunteers (March 1862).
When the Peninsular campaign began McDowell&rsquo;s corps was
detained against McClellan&rsquo;s wishes, sent away to join in the
fruitless chase of &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; Jackson in the Shenandoah
Valley, and eventually came under the command of General
Pope, taking part in the disastrous campaign of Second Bull Run.
Involved in Pope&rsquo;s disgrace, McDowell was relieved of duty in
the field (Sept. 1862), and served on the Pacific coast 1864-68.
He became, on Meade&rsquo;s death in November 1872, major-general
of regulars (a rank which he already held by brevet), and commanded
successively the department of the east, the division of
the south, and the division of the Pacific until his retirement in
1882. The latter years of his life were spent in California,
and he died at San Francisco on the 4th of May 1885. As a
commander he was uniformly unfortunate. Undoubtedly he
was a faithful, unselfish and energetic soldier, in patriotic
sympathy with the administration, and capable of great achievements.
It was his misfortune to be associated with the first
great disaster to the Union cause, to play the part of D&rsquo;Erlon
at Quatre-Bras between the armies of Banks and McClellan,
and finally to be involved in the catastrophe of Pope&rsquo;s campaign.
That he was perhaps too ready to accept great risks at the
instance of his superiors is the only just criticism to which
his military character was open.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACDUFF,<a name="ar163" id="ar163"></a></span> a police burgh and seaport of Banffshire, Scotland.
Pop. (1001), 3431. It lies on the right bank of the
mouth of the Deveron, 1 m. E. of Banff and 50¼ m. N.W. of
Aberdeen by the Great North of Scotland railway. The site
was originally occupied by the fishing village of Doune, but
after its purchase by the 1st earl of Fife, about 1732, the name
was altered to Macduff by the 2nd earl, who also procured for
it in 1783 a royal charter constituting it a burgh. In honour
of the occasion he rebuilt the market cross, in front of the
parish church. The harbour, safer and more accessible than
that of Banff, was constructed by the duke of Fife, and
transferred to the burgh in 1808. The inhabitants are chiefly
employed in the herring fishery, but there is some boat-building,
besides rope-and-sail making, manure works, saw-mills and
oilcake mills. A stone bridge across the Deveron communicates
with Banff. Good bathing facilities, a bracing climate
and a mineral well attract numerous visitors to Macduff every
summer. The burgh unites with Banff, Cullen, Elgin, Inverurie,
Kintore and Peterhead (the Elgin burghs) in returning one
member to parliament.</p>

<p><span class="bold">McDUFFIE, GEORGE<a name="ar164" id="ar164"></a></span> (1788-1851), American political leader,
was born in Columbia county, Georgia. He Was admitted to the
bar in 1814, and served in the South Carolina General Assembly
in 1818-1821, and in the national House of Representatives in
1821-1834. In 1821 he published a pamphlet in which strict
construction and states&rsquo; rights were strongly denounced; yet
in 1832 there were few more uncompromising nullificationists.
The change seems to have been gradual, and to have been
determined in part by the influence of John C. Calhoun. When,
after 1824, the old Democratic-Republican party split into
factions, he followed Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren
in opposing the Panama Congress and the policy of making
Federal appropriations for internal improvements. He did
not hesitate, however, to differ from Jackson on the two chief
issues of his administration: the Bank and nullification. In
1832 he was a prominent member of the South Carolina Nullification
Convention, and drafted its address to the people of the
United States. He served as governor in 1834-1836, during
which time he helped to reorganize South Carolina College.
From January 1843 until January 1846 he was a member of
the United States Senate. The leading Democratic measures
of those years all received his hearty support. McDuffie, like
Calhoun, became an eloquent champion of state sovereignty;
but while Calhoun emphasized state action as the only means
of redressing a grievance, McDuffie paid more attention to the
grievance itself. Influenced in large measure by Thomas
Cooper, he made it his special work to convince the people
of the South that the downfall of protection was essential
to their material progress. His argument that it is the producer
who really pays the duty of imports has been called the
economic basis of nullification. He died at Cherry Hill, Sumter
district, South Carolina, on the 11th of March 1851.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACE<a name="ar165" id="ar165"></a></span> (Fr. <i>masse</i>, O. Fr. <i>mace</i>, connected with Lat. <i>mateola</i>, a
mallet), originally a weapon of offence, made of iron, steel or
latten, capable of breaking through the strongest armour.<a name="fa1r" id="fa1r" href="#ft1r"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The
earliest <i>ceremonial</i> maces, as they afterwards became, though at
first intended to protect the king&rsquo;s person, were those borne by
the serjeants-at-arms, a royal body-guard established in France
by Philip II., and in England probably by Richard I. By the
14th century a tendency towards a more decorative serjeant&rsquo;s
mace, encased with precious metals, is noticeable. The history
of the civic mace (carried by the serjeants-at-mace) begins about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>215</span>
the middle of the 13th century, though no examples of that
period are in existence to-day. Ornamented civic maces were
considered an infringement of one of the privileges of the king&rsquo;s
serjeants, who, according to the Commons&rsquo; petition in 1344, were
alone deemed worthy of having maces enriched with costly
metals. This privilege was, however, granted to the serjeants of
London, and later to those of York (in 1396), Norwich (in 1403/4)
and Chester (in 1506). Maces covered with silver are known to
have been used at Exeter in 1387/8; two were bought at Norwich
in 1435, and others for Launceston in 1467/8. Several other
cities and towns had silver maces in the next century, and in the
16th they were almost universally used. Early in the 15th
century the flanged end of the mace, <i>i.e.</i> the head of the war mace,
was borne uppermost, and the small button with the royal arms
in the base. By the beginning of the Tudor period, however,
these blade-like flanges, originally made for offence, degenerated
into mere ornaments, while the greater importance of the end
with the royal arms (afterwards enriched with a cresting) resulted
in the reversal of the position. The custom of carrying the
flanged end upward did not die out at once: a few maces were
made to carry both ways, such as the beautiful pair of Winchcombe
silver maces, dating from the end of the 15th century.
The Guildford mace is one of the finest of the fifteen specimens
of the 15th century. The flanged ends of the maces of this period
were often beautifully pierced and decorated. These flanges gradually
became smaller, and later (in the 16th and early 17th centuries)
developed into pretty projecting scroll-brackets and other
ornaments, which remained in vogue till about 1640. The next
development in the embellishment of the shaft was the reappearance
of these small scroll-brackets on the top, immediately under
the head of the mace. They disappear altogether from the foot
in the last half of the 17th century, and are found only under the
heads, or, in rarer instances, on a knob on the shaft. The silver
mace-heads were mostly plain, with a cresting of leaves or flowers
in the 15th and 16th centuries. In the reign of James I. they
began to be engraved and decorated with heraldic devices, &amp;c.
As the custom of having serjeants&rsquo;
maces ceased (about 1650), the large
maces, borne before the mayor or
bailiffs, came into general use. Thomas
Maundy was the chief maker of maces
during the Commonwealth. He made
the mace for the House of Commons in
1649, which is the one at present in use
there, though without the original
head with the non-regal symbols, the
latter having been replaced by one
with regal symbols at the Restoration.
There are two maces in the House of
Lords, the earliest dating from the reign
of William III. The dates of the eight
large and massive silver-gilt maces of the
serjeants-at-arms, kept in the jewel-house
at the Tower of London, are as follows:
two of Charles II., two of James II.,
three of William and Mary, and one of
Queen Anne (the cypher of George I. was
subsequently added to the latter). All
the foregoing are of the type which was
almost universally adopted, with slight
differences, at the Restoration. The
civic maces of the 18th century follow
this type, with some modifications in
shape and ornamentation. The historic
English silver maces of the 18th century
include the one of 1753 at Norfolk,
Virginia, and that of 1756 of the state
of South Carolina, both in the United
States of America; two, made in 1753
and 1787, at Jamaica; that of 1791
belonging to the colony of Grenada, and
the Speaker&rsquo;s mace at Barbados, dating
from 1812; and the silver mace of the
old Irish House of Commons, 1765-1766,
now in the possession of Lord Massereene
and Ferrard.</p>

<p>Among other maces, more correctly
described as staves, in use at the present
time, are those carried before ecclesiastical
dignitaries and clergy in cathedrals
and parish churches and the maces of
the universities. At Oxford there are
three of the second half of the 16th
century and six of 1723-1724, while at
Cambridge there are three of 1626 and
one of 1628, but altered at the Commonwealth
and again at the Restoration.
The silver mace with crystal globe of
the lord high treasurer of Scotland, at
Holyrood Palace, was made about 1690
by Francis Garthorne. The remarkable
mace or sceptre of the lord mayor of
London is of crystal and gold and
set with pearls; the head dates from
the 15th century, while the mounts of
the shaft are early medieval. A mace
of an unusual form is that of the Tower ward of London, which
has a head resembling the White Tower in the Tower of
London, and which was made in the reign of Charles II.
The beautiful mace of the Cork gilds, made by Robert Goble
of Cork in 1696 for the associated gilds, of which he had been
master, is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, where there is
also a large silver mace of the middle of the 18th century, with
the arms of Pope Benedict XIV., which is said to have been
used at the coronation of Napoleon as king of Italy at Milan
in 1805.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACEDO, JOSÉ AGOSTINHO DE<a name="ar166" id="ar166"></a></span> (1761-1831), Portuguese
poet and prose writer, was born at Beja of plebeian family, and
studied Latin and rhetoric with the Oratorians in Lisbon. He
became professed as an Augustinian in 1778, but owing to his
turbulent character he spent a great part of his time in prison,
and was constantly being transferred from one convent to another,
finally giving up the monastic habit to live licentiously in
the capital. In 1792 he was unfrocked, but by the aid of powerful
friends he obtained a papal brief which secularized him and permitted
him to retain his ecclesiastical status. Taking to journalism
and preaching he now made for himself a substantial living
and a unique position. In a short time he was recognized as the
leading pulpit orator of the day, and in 1802 he became one of the
royal preachers. Macedo was the first to introduce from abroad
and to cultivate didactic and descriptive poetry, the best example
of which is his notable transcendental poem <i>Meditation</i> (1813).
His colossal egotism made him attempt to supersede Camoens as
Portugal&rsquo;s greatest poet, and in 1814 he produced <i>Oriente</i>, an
insipid epic notwithstanding its correct and vigorous verse,
dealing with the same subject as the <i>Lusiads</i>&mdash;Gama&rsquo;s discovery
of the sea route to India. This amended paraphrase met with a
cold reception, whereupon Macedo published his <i>Censura dos
Lusiadas</i>, containing a minute examination and virulent indictment
of Camoens. Macedo founded and wrote for a large number
of journals, and the tone and temper of these and his political
pamphlets induced his leading biographer to name him the &ldquo;chief
libeller&rdquo; of Portugal, though at the time his jocular and satirical
style gained him popular favour. An extreme adherent of
absolutism, he expended all his brilliant powers of invective
against the Constitutionalists, and advocated a general massacre
of the opponents of the Miguelite régime. Notwithstanding his
priestly office and old age, he continued his aggressive journalistic
campaign, until his own party, feeling that he was damaging the
cause by his excesses, threatened him with proceedings, which
caused him in 1829 to resign the post of censor of books for the
Ordinary, to which he had been appointed in 1824. Though
his ingratitude was proverbial, and his moral character of the
worst, when he died in 1831 he left behind him many friends, a
host of admirers, and a great but ephemeral literary reputation.
His ambition to rank as the king of letters led to his famous
conflict with Bocage (<i>q.v.</i>), whose poem <i>Pena de Talião</i> was perhaps
the hardest blow Macedo ever received. His malignity
reached its height in a satirical poem in six cantos, <i>Os Burros</i>
(1812-1814), in which he pilloried by name men and women of all
grades of society, living and dead, with the utmost licence of
expression. His translation of the <i>Odes</i> of Horace, and his dramatic
attempts, are only of value as evidence of the extraordinary
versatility of the man, but his treatise, if his it be, <i>A Demonstration
of the Existence of God</i>, at least proves his possession of very high
mental powers. As a poet, his odes on Wellington and the
emperor Alexander show true inspiration, and the poems of the
same nature in his <i>Lyra anacreontica</i>, addressed to his mistress,
have considerable merit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACEDONIA,<a name="ar167" id="ar167"></a></span> the name generally given to that portion of
European Turkey which is bounded on the N. by the Kara-Dagh
mountain range and the frontier of Bulgaria, on the E.
by the river Mesta, on the S. by the Aegean Sea and the frontier
of Greece, and on the W. by an ill-defined line coinciding with
the mountain chains of Shar (ancient <i>Scardus</i>) Grammus and
Pindus. The Macedonia of antiquity was originally confined
to the inland region west of the Axius, between that river and the
Scardus range, and did not include the northern portion, known
as Paeonia, or the coast-land, which, with the eastern districts,
was inhabited by Thracian tribes; the people of the country
were not Hellenic. In modern Macedonia are included the
vilayet of Salonica (Turk. <i>Selanik</i>), the eastern and greater portion
of the vilayet of Monastir (sanjaks of Monastir, Servia
[Turk. <i>Selfije</i>], and part of that of Kortcha), and the south-eastern
portion of the vilayet of Kossovo (sanjak of Usküb).
The greater part of Macedonia is inhabited by a Slavonic
population, mainly Bulgarian in its characteristics; the coast-line
and the southern districts west of the Gulf of Salonica by
Greeks, while Turkish, Vlach and Albanian settlements exist
sporadically, or in groups, in many parts of the country.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geographical Features.</i>&mdash;The coast-line is broken by the remarkable
peninsula of Chalcidice, with its three promontories of Athos
(ancient <i>Acte</i>), Longus (<i>Sithonia</i>) and Cassandra (<i>Pallene</i>). The
country is divided into two almost equal portions by the river
Vardar (<i>Axius</i>), the valley of which has always constituted the
principal route from Central Europe to the Aegean. Rising in the
Shar mountains near Gostivar (Bulgarian <i>Kostovo</i>), the Vardar,
flowing to the N.E., drains the rich elevated plain of Tetovo (Turk.
<i>Kalkandelen</i>) and, turning to the S.E. at the foot of Mt Liubotrn,
traverses the town and plain of Usküb, leaving to the left the high
plateau of Ovchepolye (&ldquo;the sheep-plain&rdquo;); then flowing through
the town of Veles, it receives on its right, near the ruins of the ancient
Stobi, the waters of its principal tributary, the Tcherna (<i>Erigon</i>),
which drains the basin of Monastir and the mountainous region of
Morichovo, and after passing through the picturesque gorge of
Demir-Kapu (the Iron Gate) finds its way to the Gulf of Salonica
through the alluvial tract known as the Campania, extending to the
west of that town. The other important rivers are the Struma
(<i>Strymon</i>) and Mesta (<i>Nestus</i>) to the east, running almost parallel
to the Vardar, and the Bistritza in the south, all falling into the
Aegean. (The Black Drin, issuing from Lake Ochrida and flowing
N.W. to the Adriatic, is for the greater part of its course an Albanian
river.) The Struma, which rises in Mt Vitosha in Bulgaria, runs
through a narrow defile till, within a short distance of the sea, it
expands into Lake Tachino, and falls into the Aegean near the site
of the ancient Amphipolis. The Mesta, rising in the Rhodope range,
drains the valley of Razlog and forms a delta at its entrance into the
Aegean opposite the island of Thasos. The Bistritza, which has its
source in the eastern slope of Mt Grammus, receives early in its
course the outflow from Lake Castoria on the left; it flows to the
S.E. towards the frontier of Greece, where its course is arrested by
the Cambunian mountains; then turning sharply to the N.E., and
passing through the districts of Serfije and Verria, it reaches the
Campania and enters the Gulf of Salonica at a point a few miles to
the S.W. of the mouth of the Vardar. The valleys of most of the
rivers and their tributaries broaden here and there into fertile upland
basins, which were formerly lakes. Of these the extensive plateau
of Monastir, the ancient plain of Pelagonia, about 1500 ft. above
the sea, is the most remarkable; the basins of Tetovo, Usküb,
Kotchané, Strumnitza, Nevrokop, Melnik, Serres and Drama furnish
other examples. The principal lakes are Ochrida (<i>Lychnitis</i>) on the
confines of Albania; Prespa, separated from Ochrida by the Galinitza
mountains, and supposed to be connected with it by a subterranean
channel; Castoria, to the S.E. of Prespa; Ostrovo, midway between
Prespa and the Vardar; Tachino (<i>Cercinitis</i>) on the lower course of
the Struma; Beshik (<i>Bolbe</i>), separating the Chalcidian peninsula
from the mainland, and Doiran (probably <i>Prasias</i>), beneath the
southern declivity of the Belasitza mountains; the smaller lakes of
Amatovo and Yenije are in the alluvial plain on either side of the
lower Vardar. Lake Ochrida (<i>q.v.</i>) finds egress into the Black Drin
(<i>Drilon</i>) at Struga, where there are productive fisheries. The
lacustrine habitations of the Paeonians on Lake Prasias described
by Herodotus (v. 16) find a modern counterpart in the huts of the
fishing population on Lake Doiran. The surface of the country is
generally mountainous; the various mountain-groups present little
uniformity in their geographical contour. The great chain of
Rhodope, continued to the N.W. by the Rilska and Osogovska
Planina, forms a natural boundary on the north; the principal
summit, Musalla (9031 ft.), is just over the Bulgarian frontier. The
adjoining Dospat range culminates in Belmeken (8562 ft.), also just
over the Bulgarian frontier. Between the upper courses of the
Mesta and Struma is the Perim Dagh or Pirin Planina (<i>Orbelos</i>) with
Elin (8794 ft.), continued to the south by the Bozo Dagh (6081 ft.);
still further south, overlooking the bay of Kavala, are the Bunar Dagh
and Mt Pangaeus, famous in antiquity for its gold and silver mines.
Between the Struma and the Vardar are the Belasitza, Krusha and
other ranges. West of the Vardar is the lofty Shar chain (<i>Scardus</i>)
overlooking the plain of Tetovo and terminating at its eastern
extremity in the pyramidal Liubotrn (according to some authorities,
10,007 ft., and consequently the highest mountain in the Peninsula;
according to others 8989, 8856, or 8200 ft.). The Shar range, with
the Kara Dagh to the east, forms the natural boundary of Macedonia
on the N.W.; this is prolonged on the west by the Yaina-Bistra and
Yablanitza mountains with several summits exceeding 7000 ft. in
height, the Odonishta Planina overlooking Lake Ochrida on the west,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>217</span>
the Morova Planina, the Grammus range, and Pindus with Smolika
(8546 ft.). The series of heights is broken by the valleys of the
Black Drin and Devol, which flow to the Adriatic. Between the
Vardar and the plain of Monastir the Nija range culminates in
Kaimakchalan (8255 ft.); south-west of Monastir is Mt Peristeri
(7720 ft.) overlooking Lake Prespa on the east; on the west is the
Galinitza range separating it from Lake Ochrida. Between Lake
Ostrovo and the lower Bistritza are the Bermius and Kitarion
ranges with Doxa (5240 ft.) and Turla (about 3280 ft.). South of
the Bistritza are the Cambunian mountains forming the boundary
of Thessaly and terminating to the east in the imposing mass of
Etymbos, or Olympus (9794 ft.). Lastly, Mt Athos, at the extremity
of the peninsula of that name, reaches the height of 6350 ft.
The general aspect of the country is bare and desolate, especially
in the neighbourhood of the principal routes; the trees have been
destroyed, and large tracts of land remain uncultivated. Magnificent
forests, however, still clothe the slopes of Rhodope, Pirin and Pindus.
The well-wooded and cultivated districts of Grevena and Castoria,
which are mainly inhabited by a Vlach population, are remarkably
beautiful, and the scenery around Lakes Ochrida and Prespa is
exceedingly picturesque. For the principal geological formations
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Balkan Peninsula</a></span>.</p>

<p>The climate is severe; the spring is often rainy, and the melted
snows from the encircling mountains produce inundations in the
plains. The natural products are in general similar to those of
southern Bulgaria and Servia&mdash;the fig, olive and orange, however,
appear on the shores of the Aegean and in the sheltered valleys of
the southern region. The best tobacco in Europe is grown in the
Drama and Kavala districts; rice and cotton are cultivated in the
southern plains.</p>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;The population of Macedonia may perhaps be
estimated at 2,200,000. About 1,300,000 are Christians of various
churches and nationalities; more than 800,000 are Mahommedans,
and about 75,000 are Jews. Of the Christians, the great majority
profess the Eastern Orthodox faith, owning allegiance either to
the Greek patriarchate or the Bulgarian exarchate. Among the
Orthodox Christians are reckoned some 4000 Turks. The small
Catholic minority is composed chiefly of Uniate Bulgarians (about
3600), occupying the districts of Kukush and Doiran; there are also
some 2000 Bulgarian Protestants, principally inhabiting the valley
of Razlog. The Mahommedan population is mainly composed of
Turks (about 500,000). In addition to these there are some 130,000
Bulgars, 120,000 Albanians, 35,000 gipsies and 14,000 Greeks,
together with a smaller number of Vlachs, Jews and Circassians,
who profess the creed of Islam. The untrustworthy Turkish
statistics take religion, not nationality, as the basis of classification.
All Moslems are included in the <i>millet</i>, or nation, of Islam. The
Rûm, or Roman (<i>i.e.</i> Greek) <i>millet</i> comprises all those who acknowledge
the authority of the Oecumenical patriarch, and consequently
includes, in addition to the Greeks, the Servians, the Vlachs, and a
certain number of Bulgarians; the Bulgar <i>millet</i> comprises the
Bulgarians who accept the rule of the exarchate; the other <i>millets</i>
are the <i>Katolik</i> (Catholics), <i>Ermeni</i> (Gregorian Armenians), <i>Musevi</i>
(Jews) and <i>Prodesdan</i> (Protestants). The population of Macedonia,
at all times scanty, has undoubtedly diminished in recent years.
There has been a continual outflow of the Christian population in
the direction of Bulgaria, Servia and Greece, and a corresponding
emigration of the Turkish peasantry to Asia Minor. Many of the
smaller villages are being abandoned by their inhabitants, who
migrate for safety to the more considerable towns&mdash;usually situated
at some point where a mountain pass descends to the outskirts of
the plains. In the agricultural districts the Christian peasants, or
<i>rayas</i>, are either small proprietors or cultivate holdings on the
estates of Turkish landowners. The upland districts are thinly
inhabited by a nomad pastoral population.</p>

<p><i>Towns.</i>&mdash;The principal towns are Salonica (pop. in 1910, about
130,000), Monastir (60,000), each the capital of a vilayet, and
Usküb (32,000), capital of the vilayet of Kossovo. In the Salonica
vilayet are Serres (28,000), pleasantly situated in a fertile valley near
Lake Tachino; Nevrokop (6200), Mehomia (5000), and Bansko
(6500), in the valley of the Upper Mesta; Drama (9000), at the foot
of the Bozo Dagh, with its port Kavala (9500); Djumaia (6440),
Melnik (4300) and Demir Hissar (5840) in the valley of the Struma,
with Strumnitza (10,160) and Petrich (7100) in the valley of its
tributary, the Strumnitza; Veles (Turk. <i>Koprülü</i>) on the Vardar
(19,700); Doiran (6780) and Kukush (7750); and, to the west of
the Vardar, Verria (Slav. <i>Ber</i>, anc. <i>Beroea</i>, Turk. <i>Karaferia</i>, 10,500),
Yenijé-Vardar (9599) and Vodena (anc. <i>Edessa</i>, <i>q.v.</i>, 11,000). In
the portion of the Kossovo vilayet included in Macedonia are
Kalkandelen (Slav. <i>Tetovo</i>, 19,200), Kumanovo (14,500) and Shtip
(Turk. <i>Istib</i>, 21,000). In the Monastir vilayet are Prilep (24,000)
at the northern end of the Pelagonian plain, Krushevo (9350),
mainly inhabited by Vlachs, Resen (4450) north of Lake Prespa,
Florina (Slav. <i>Lerin</i>, 9824); Ochrida (14,860), with a picturesque
fortress of Tsar Samuel, and Struga (4570), both on the north shore
of Lake Ochrida; Dibra (Slav. <i>Debr</i>) on the confines of Albania
(15,500), Castoria (Slav. <i>Kostur</i>), on the lake of that name (6190),
and Kozhané (6100). (Dibra, Kavala, Monastir, Ochrida, Salonica,
Serres, Usküb and Vodena are described in separate articles.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Races.</i>&mdash;Macedonia is the principal theatre of the struggle of
nationalities in Eastern Europe. All the races which dispute
the reversion of the Turkish possessions in Europe
are represented within its borders. The Macedonian
<span class="sidenote">The Turks.</span>
probably may therefore be described as the quintessence of the
Near Eastern Question. The Turks, the ruling race, form less
than a quarter of the entire population, and their numbers are
steadily declining. The first Turkish immigration from Asia
Minor took place under the Byzantine emperors before the conquest
of the country. The first purely Turkish town, Yenijé-Vardar,
was founded on the ruins of Vardar in 1362. After the
capture of Salonica (1430), a strong Turkish population was settled
in the city, and similar colonies were founded in Monastir,
Ochrida, Serres, Drama and other important places. In many
of these towns half or more of the population is still Turkish.
A series of military colonies were subsequently established at
various points of strategic importance along the principal lines
of communication. Before 1360 large numbers of nomad
shepherds, or Yuruks, from the district of Konia, in Asia Minor,
had settled in the country; their descendants are still known as
Konariotes. Further immigration from this region took place
from time to time up to the middle of the 18th century. After
the establishment of the feudal system in 1397 many of the
Seljuk noble families came over from Asia Minor; their descendants
may be recognized among the beys or Moslem landowners
in southern Macedonia. At the beginning of the 18th century
the Turkish population was very considerable, but since that time
it has continuously decreased. A low birth-rate, the exhaustion
of the male population by military service, and great mortality
from epidemics, against which Moslem fatalism takes no precautions,
have brought about a decline which has latterly been
hastened by emigration. On the other hand, there has been a
considerable Moslem immigration from Bosnia, Servia, Bulgaria
and Greece, but the newcomers, <i>mohajirs</i>, do not form a permanent
colonizing element. The Turkish rural population is
found in three principal groups: the most easterly extends from
the Mesta to Drama, Pravishta and Orfano, reaching the sea-coast
on either side of Kavala, which is partly Turkish, partly
Greek. The second, or central, group begins on the sea-coast,
a little west of the mouth of the Strymon, where a Greek population
intervenes, and extends to the north-west along the Kara-Dagh
and Belasitza ranges in the direction of Strumnitza, Veles,
Shtip and Radovisht. The third, or southern, group is centred
around Kaïlar, an entirely Turkish town, and extends from Lake
Ostrovo to Selfijé (Servia). The second and third groups are
mainly composed of Konariot shepherds. Besides these fairly
compact settlements there are numerous isolated Turkish
colonies in various parts of the country. The Turkish rural
population is quiet, sober and orderly, presenting some of the
best characteristics of the race. The urban population, on the
other hand, has become much demoralized, while the official
classes, under the rule of Abdul Hamid II. and his predecessors,
were corrupt and avaricious, and seemed to have parted with
all scruple in their dealings with the Christian peasantry. The
Turks, though still numerically and politically strong, fall behind
the other nationalities in point of intellectual culture, and the
contrast is daily becoming more marked owing to the educational
activity of the Christians.</p>

<p>The Greek and Vlach populations are not always easily distinguished,
as a considerable proportion of the Vlachs have
been hellenized. Both show a remarkable aptitude
for commerce; the Greeks have maintained their
<span class="sidenote">The Greeks and Vlachs.</span>
language and religion, and the Vlachs their religion,
with greater tenacity than any of the other races. From the date
of the Ottoman conquest until comparatively recent times, the
Greeks occupied an exceptional position in Macedonia, as elsewhere
in the Turkish Empire, owing to the privileges conferred
on the patriarchate of Constantinople, and the influence subsequently
acquired by the great Phanariot families. All the Christian
population belonged to the Greek <i>millet</i> and called itself Greek; the
bishops and higher clergy were exclusively Greek; Greek was the
language of the upper classes, of commerce, literature and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>218</span>
religion, and Greek alone was taught in the schools. The supremacy
of the patriarchate was consummated by the suppression of the
autocephalous Slavonic churches of Ipek in 1766 and Ochrida
in 1767. In the latter half of the 18th century Greek ascendancy
in Macedonia was at its zenith; its decline began with the War
of Independence, the establishment of the Hellenic kingdom, and
the extinction of the Phanariot power in Constantinople. The
patriarchate, nevertheless, maintained its exclusive jurisdiction
over all the Orthodox population till 1870, when the Bulgarian
exarchate was established, and the Greek clergy continued to
labour with undiminished zeal for the spread of Hellenism.
Notwithstanding their venality and intolerance, their merits as
the only diffusers of culture and enlightenment in the past
should not be overlooked. The process of hellenization made
greater progress in the towns than in the rural districts of the
interior, where the non-Hellenic populations preserved their
languages, which alone saved the several nationalities from extinction.
The typical Greek, with his superior education, his
love of politics and commerce, and his distaste for laborious
occupations, has always been a dweller in cities. In Salonica,
Serres, Kavala, Castoria, and other towns in southern Macedonia
the Hellenic element is strong; in the northern towns it is insignificant,
except at Melnik, which is almost exclusively Greek.
The Greek rural population extends from the Thessalian frontier
to Castoria and Verria (<i>Beroea</i>); it occupies the whole
Chalcidian peninsula and both banks of the lower Strymon from
Serres to the sea, and from Nigrita on the west to Pravishta on
the east; there are also numerous Greek villages in the Kavala
district. The Mahommedan Greeks, known as Valachides,
occupy a considerable tract in the upper Bistritza valley near
Grevena and Liapsista. The purely Greek population of Macedonia
may possibly be estimated at a quarter of a million. The
Vlachs, or Rumans, who call themselves <i>Aromuni</i> or <i>Aromâni</i>
(<i>i.e.</i> Romans), are also known as <i>Kutzovlachs</i> and <i>Tzintzars</i>:
the last two appellations are, in fact, nicknames, &ldquo;Kutzovlach&rdquo;
meaning &ldquo;lame Vlach,&rdquo; while &ldquo;Tzintzar&rdquo; denotes their inability
to pronounce the Rumanian <i>cinc&#301;</i> (five). The Vlachs are
styled by some writers &ldquo;Macedo-Rumans,&rdquo; in contradistinction
to the &ldquo;Daco-Rumans,&rdquo; who inhabit the country north of the
Danube. They are, in all probability, the descendants of the
Thracian branch of the aboriginal Thraco-Illyrian population
of the Balkan Peninsula, the Illyrians being represented by the
Albanians. This early native population, which was apparently
hellenized to some extent under the Macedonian empire, seems
to have been latinized in the period succeeding the Roman
conquest, and probably received a considerable infusion of
Italian blood. The Vlachs are for the most part either highland
shepherds or wandering owners of horses and mules. Their
settlements are scattered all over the mountains of Macedonia:
some of these consist of permanent dwellings, others of huts
occupied only in the summer. The compactest groups are found
in the Pindus and Agrapha mountains (extending into Albania
and Thessaly), in the neighbourhood of Monastir, Grevena and
Castoria, and in the district of Meglen. The Vlachs who settle
in the lowland districts are excellent husbandmen. The urban
population is considerable; the Vlachs of Salonica, Monastir,
Serres and other large towns are, for the most part, descended
from refugees from Moschopolis, once the principal centre of
Macedonian commerce. The towns of Metzovo, on the confines
of Albania, and Klisura, in the Bistritza valley, are almost
exclusively Vlach. The urban and most of the rural Vlachs are
bilingual, speaking Greek as well as Rumanian; a great number
of the former have been completely hellenized, partly in consequence
of mixed marriages, and many of the wealthiest commercial
families of Vlach origin are now devoted to the Greek cause.
The Vlachs of Macedonia possibly number 90,000, of whom only
some 3000 are Mahommedans. The Macedonian dialect of the
Rumanian language differs mainly from that spoken north of
the Danube in its vocabulary and certain phonetic peculiarities;
it contains a number of Greek <span class="correction" title="amended from works">words</span> which are often replaced
in the northern speech by Slavonic or Latin synonyms.</p>

<p>The Albanians, called by the Turks and Slavs <i>Arnauts</i>, by
the Greeks <span class="grk" title="Apbanitai">&#7944;&#961;&#946;&#945;&#957;&#8150;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>, and by themselves <i>Shkyipetar</i>, have
always been the scourge of western Macedonia. After the
first Turkish invasion of Albania many of the chiefs
<span class="sidenote">The Albanians, Circassians, &amp;c.</span>
or beys adopted Mahommedanism, but the conversion
of the great bulk of the people took place in the
16th and 17th centuries. Professing the creed of
the dominant power and entitled to bear arms, the Albanians
were enabled to push forward their limits at the expense of the
defenceless population around them, and their encroachments
have continued to the present day. They have not only
advanced themselves, but have driven to the eastward numbers
of their Christian compatriots and a great portion of the once-prosperous
Vlach population of Albania. Albanian revolts and
disturbances have been frequent along the western confines of
Macedonia, especially in the neighbourhood of Dibra: the
Slavonic peasants have been the principal sufferers from these
troubles, while the Porte, in pursuance of the &ldquo;Islamic policy&rdquo;
adopted by the sultan Abdul Hamid II., dealt tenderly with the
recalcitrant believers. In southern Macedonia the Albanians
of the Tosk race extend over the upper Bistritza valley as far
west as Castoria, and reach the southern and western shores of
Lakes Prespa and Ochrida: they are also numerous in the neighbourhood
of Monastir. In northern Macedonia the Albanians
are of the Gheg stock: they have advanced in large numbers
over the districts of Dibra, Kalkandelen and Usküb, driving the
Slavonic population before them. The total number of Albanians
in Macedonia may be estimated at about 120,000, of whom
some 10,000 are Christians (chiefly orthodox Tosks). The
Circassians, who occupy some villages in the neighbourhood of
Serres, now scarcely number 3000: their predatory instincts
may be compared with those of the Albanians. The Jews had
colonies in Macedonia in the time of St Paul, but no trace remains
of these early settlements. The Jews now found in the country
descend from refugees who fled from Spain during the persecutions
at the end of the 15th century: they speak a dialect of
Spanish, which they write with Hebrew characters. They form
a flourishing community at Salonica, which numbers more
than half the population: their colonies at Monastir, Serres and
other towns are poor. A small proportion of the Jews, known
as <i>Deunmé</i> by the Turks, have embraced Mahommedanism.</p>

<p>With the exception of the southern and western districts
already specified, the principal towns, and certain isolated tracts,
the whole of Macedonia is inhabited by a race or
races speaking a Slavonic dialect. If language is
<span class="sidenote">The Slavonic Population.</span>
adopted as a test, the great bulk of the rural population
must be described as Slavonic. The Slavs first crossed the
Danube at the beginning of the 3rd century, but their great
immigration took place in the 6th and 7th centuries. They
overran the entire peninsula, driving the Greeks to the shores of
the Aegean, the Albanians into the Mirdite country, and the
latinized population of Macedonia into the highland districts,
such as Pindus, Agrapha and Olympus. The Slavs, a primitive
agricultural and pastoral people, were often unsuccessful in
their attacks on the fortified towns, which remained centres of
Hellenism. In the outlying parts of the peninsula they were
absorbed, or eventually driven back, by the original populations,
but in the central region they probably assimilated a considerable
proportion of the latinized races. The western portions of the
peninsula were occupied by Serb and Slovene tribes: the Slavs
of the eastern and central portions were conquered at the end of
the 7th century by the Bulgarians, a Ugro-Finnish horde, who
established a despotic political organization, but being less
numerous than the subjected race were eventually absorbed by
it. The Mongolian physical type, which prevails in the districts
between the Balkans and the Danube, is also found in central
Macedonia, and may be recognized as far west as Ochrida and
Dibra. In general, however, the Macedonian Slavs differ somewhat
both in appearance and character from their neighbours
beyond the Bulgarian and Servian frontiers: the peculiar type
which they present is probably due to a considerable admixture of
Vlach, Hellenic, Albanian and Turkish blood, and to the influence
of the surrounding races. Almost all independent authorities,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>219</span>
however, agree that the bulk of the Slavonic population of Macedonia
is Bulgarian. The principal indication is furnished by the
language, which, though resembling Servian in some respects
(<i>e.g.</i> the case-endings, which are occasionally retained), presents
most of the characteristic features of Bulgarian (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bulgaria</a></span>:
<i>Language</i>). Among these may be mentioned the suffix-article,
the nasal vowels (retained in the neighbourhood of Salonica and
Castoria, but modified elsewhere as in Bulgarian), the retention of
<i>l</i> (<i>e.g.</i> <i>vulk</i> &ldquo;wolf,&rdquo; <i>bel</i> &ldquo;white&rdquo;; Servian <i>vuk</i>, <i>beo</i>), and the loss
of the infinitive. There are at least four Slavonic dialects in
Macedonia, but the suffix-article, though varying in form, is a
constant feature in all. The Slavs of western Macedonia are of a
lively, enterprising character, and share the commercial aptitude
of the Vlachs: those of the eastern and southern regions are a
quiet, sober, hardworking agricultural race, more obviously
homogeneous with the population of Bulgaria. In upper Macedonia
large family communities, resembling the Servian and
Bulgarian <i>zadruga</i>, are commonly found: they sometimes number
over 50 members. The whole Slavonic population of Macedonia
may be estimated at about 1,150,000, of whom about 1,000,000
are Christians of the Orthodox faith. The majority of these own
allegiance to the Bulgarian exarchate, but a certain minority
still remains faithful to the Greek patriarchate. The Moslem
Bulgarians form a considerable element: they are found principally
in the valley of the upper Mesta and the Rhodope district,
where they are known as <i>Pomaks</i> or &ldquo;helpers,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> auxiliaries
to the Turkish army.</p>

<p><i>The Racial Propaganda.</i>&mdash;The embittered struggle of the rival
nationalities in Macedonia dates from the middle of the 19th
century. Until that period the Greeks, owing to their superior
culture and their privileged position, exercised an exclusive influence
over the whole population professing the Orthodox
faith. All Macedonia was either Moslem or Orthodox Christian,
without distinction of nationalities, the Catholic or Protestant
<i>millets</i> being inconsiderable. The first opposition to Greek
ecclesiastical ascendancy came from the Bulgarians. The Bulgarian
literary revival, which took place in the earlier part of the
19th century, was the precursor of the ecclesiastical and national
movement which resulted in the establishment of the exarchate
in 1870 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bulgaria</a></span>). In the course of the struggle some of
the Bulgarian leaders entered into negotiations with Rome; a
Bulgarian Uniate church was recognized by the Porte, and the
pope nominated a bishop, who, however, was mysteriously
deported to Russia a few days after his consecration (1861).
The first exarch, who was elected in 1871, was excommunicated
with all his followers by the patriarch, and a considerable number
of Bulgarians in Macedonia&mdash;the so-called &ldquo;Bulgarophone
Greeks&rdquo;&mdash;fearing the reproach of schism, or influenced by other
considerations, refrained from acknowledging the new spiritual
power. Many of the recently converted uniates, on the other
hand, offered their allegiance to the exarch. The firman of the
28th of February 1870 specified a number of districts within the
present boundaries of Bulgaria and Servia, as well as in Macedonia,
to which Bulgarian bishops might be appointed; other districts
might be subjected to the exarchate should two-thirds of the
inhabitants so desire. In virtue of the latter provision the districts
of Veles, Ochrida and Usküb declared for the exarchate,
but the Turkish government refrained from sanctioning the
nomination of Bulgarian bishops to these dioceses. It was not
till 1891 that the Porte, at the instance of Stamboloff, the Bulgarian
prime minister, whose demands were supported by the
Triple Alliance and Great Britain, issued the <i>berat</i>, or exequatur,
for Bulgarian bishops at Ochrida and Usküb; the sees of Veles
and Nevrokop received Bulgarian prelates in 1894, and those of
Monastir, Strumnitza and Dibra in 1898. The Bulgarian position
was further strengthened in the latter year by the establishment
of &ldquo;commercial agents&rdquo; representing the principality at
Salonica, Usküb, Monastir and Serres. During this period
(1891-1898) the Bulgarian propaganda, entirely controlled by
the spiritual power and conducted within the bounds of legality,
made rapid and surprising progress. Subsequently the interference
of the Macedonian committee at Sofia, in which the
advocates of physical force predominated, and the rivalry of factions
did much to injure the movement; the hostility of the Porte
was provoked and the sympathy of the powers alienated by a
series of assassinations and other crimes. According to the official
figures, the Bulgarian schools, which in 1893 were 554, with
30,267 pupils and 853 teachers, in 1900 numbered 785 (including
5 gymnasia and 58 secondary schools), with 39,892 pupils and
1250 teachers. A great number of the schools were closed by
the Turkish authorities after the insurrection of 1903 and many
had not been reopened in 1909; the teachers were imprisoned or
had fled into exile.</p>

<p>The Rumanian movement comes next to the Bulgarian in
order of time. The Vlachs had shown greater susceptibility to
Greek influence than any of the other non-Hellenic populations
of Macedonia, and, though efforts to create a Rumanian propaganda
were made as early as 1855, it was not till after the union
of the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1861 that any
indications of a national sentiment appeared amongst them. In
1886 the principal apostle of the Rumanian cause, a priest named
Apostol Margaritis, founded a gymnasium at Monastir, and the
movement, countenanced by the Porte, supported by the French
Catholic missions, and to some extent encouraged by Austria,
has made no inconsiderable progress since that time. There
are now about forty Rumanian schools in Macedonia, including
two gymnasia, and large sums are devoted to their maintenance
by the ministry of education at Bucharest, which also provides
qualified teachers. The Rumanian and Servian movements
are at a disadvantage compared with the Bulgarian, owing to
their want of a separate ecclesiastical organization, the orthodox
Vlachs and Serbs in Turkey owning allegiance to the Greek
patriarchate. The governments of Bucharest and Belgrade
therefore endeavoured to obtain the recognition of Vlach and
Servian <i>millets</i>, demanding respectively the establishment of
a Rumanian bishopric at Monastir and the restoration of the
patriarchate of Ipek with the appointment of a Servian metropolitan
at Usküb. The Vlach <i>millet</i> was recognized by the
Porte by iradé on the 23rd of May 1905, but the aims of the
Servians, whose active interference in Macedonia is of comparatively
recent date, have not been realized. Previously to 1878
the hopes of the Servians were centred on Bosnia, Herzegovina
and the vilayet of Kossovo; but when the Berlin Treaty assigned
Bosnia and Herzegovina to Austria, the national aspirations
were directed to Macedonia, the Slavonic population of which
was declared to be Servian. The strained relations existing
between Russia and Bulgaria from 1886 to 1895 were to the
advantage of the Servian propaganda, which after 1890 made
remarkable progress. Great expenditure has been incurred by
the Servian government in the opening and maintenance of
schools. At the beginning of 1899 there were stated to be 178
Servian schools in the vilayets of Usküb, Salonica and Monastir
(including fifteen gymnasia), with 321 teachers and 7200 pupils.</p>

<p>The Albanian movement is still in an inceptive stage; owing
to the persistent prohibition of Albanian schools by the Turks,
a literary propaganda, the usual precursor of a national revival,
was rendered impossible till the outbreak of the Young Turk
revolution in July 1908. After that date numerous schools
were founded and an Albanian committee, meeting in November
1908, fixed the national alphabet and decided on the adoption
of the Latin character. The educational movement is most
conspicuous among the Tosks, or southern Albanians. Notwithstanding
the encroachments of their rivals, the impoverishment
of the patriarchate, and the injury inflicted on their cause by
the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, the Greeks still maintain a large
number of schools; according to statistics prepared at Athens
there were in 1901, 927 Greek schools in the vilayets of Salonica
and Monastir (including five gymnasia), with 1397 teachers and
57,607 pupils. The great educational activity displayed by
the proselytizing movements in Macedonia, while tending to the
artificial creation of parties, daily widens the contrast between the
progressive Christian and the backward Moslem populations.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Antiquities.</i>&mdash;Macedonia, like the neighbouring Balkan countries,
still awaited exploration at the beginning of the 20th century, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>
little had been learned of the earlier development of civilization in
these regions. The ancient indigenous population has left many
traces of its presence in the tumuli which occur on the plains, and
more especially along the valley of the Vardar. The unquiet state
of the country went far to prevent any systematic investigation of
these remains; excavations, however, were made by Körte and
Franke at Niausta and near Salonica (see Kretschner, <i>Einleitung in
die Geschichte der griechischen Sprache</i>, pp. 176, 421), and fragments of
primitive pottery, with peculiar characteristics, were found by
Perdrizet at Tchepelje, on the left bank of Lake Tachino. The oldest
archaeological monuments of Macedonia are its coins, for which the
mines of Crenides (the later Philippi), at the foot of Mt Pangaeus,
of Chalcidice, of the island of Thasos, and of the mountains between
Lake Prasias and the ancient Macedonian kingdom (Herod. v. 17),
furnished abundance of metal. From the reign of Alexander I.,
in the epoch of the Persian wars (502-479 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), the Macedonian
dynasty issued silver coins of a purely Greek style. The Thracian
communities around Mt Pangaeus also produced a variety of coins,
especially at the beginning of the 5th century. The great octodrachms
of this period were perhaps struck for the purpose of paying
tribute to the Persians when the country between the Strymon and
the Nestos was in their possession; most of the specimens have
been found in Asia Minor. These large pieces present many characteristics
of the Ionian style; it is evident that the Thracians derived
the arts of minting and engraving from the neighbouring Thasos,
itself a colony from the Ionian Paros. The monarchs of Pella were
enthusiastic admirers of Hellenic culture, and their court was
doubtless frequented by Greek sculptors as well as men of letters,
such as Herodotus and Euripides. At Pella has been found a
funerary <i>stele</i> of the late 5th or early 4th century representing a
Macedonian <i>hetaerus</i>&mdash;a beautiful specimen of the best Greek art,
now preserved in the Imperial Ottoman Museum at Constantinople.
To the Hellenic period belong the vaulted tombs under tumuli discovered
at Pella, Pydna, Palatitza, and other places; the dead were
laid in marble couches ornamented with sculptures, like those of the
so-called sarcophagus of Alexander at Constantinople. These tombs
doubtless received the remains of the Macedonian nobles and <i>hetaeri</i>:
in one of them a fresco representing a conflict between a horseman
and a warrior on foot has been brought to light by Kinch. Similarly
constructed places of sepulture have been found at Eretria and elsewhere
in Greece. At Palatitza the ruins of a remarkable structure,
perhaps a palace, have been laid bare by Heuzey and Daumet.
Unlike Greece, where each independent city had its acropolis, Macedonia
offers few remnants of ancient fortification; most of the country
towns appear to have been nothing more than open market-centres.
The most interesting ruins in the country are those of the Roman and
Byzantine epochs, especially those at Salonica (<i>q.v.</i>). The Byzantine
fortifications and aqueduct of Kavala are also remarkable.
At Verria (<i>Beroea</i>) may be seen some Christian remains, at Melnik
a palace of the age of the Comneni, at Serres a fortress built by the
Servian tsar Stephen Dushan (1336-1356). The remains at Filibejik
(<i>Philippi</i>) are principally of the Roman and Byzantine periods;
the numerous <i>ex voto</i> rock-tablets of the acropolis are especially
interesting. The Roman inscriptions found in Macedonia are mainly
funerary, but include several ephebic lists. The funerary tablets
afford convincing proof of the persistence of the Thracian element,
notwithstanding hellenization and latinization; many of them, for
instance, represent the well-known Thracian horseman hunting the
wild boar. The monastic communities on the promontory of Athos
(<i>q.v.</i>), with their treasures of Byzantine art and their rich collections
of manuscripts, are of the highest antiquarian interest.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;For the history of ancient Macedonia see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Macedonian
Empire</a></span>.<a name="fa1s" id="fa1s" href="#ft1s"><span class="sp">1</span></a> After its subjugation by the Romans the
country was divided into four districts separated by rigid
political and social limitations. Before long it was constituted
a province, which in the time of Augustus was assigned to the
senate. Thenceforward it followed the fortunes of the Roman
empire, and, after the partition of that dominion, of its eastern
branch. Its Thraco-Illyrian inhabitants had already been
largely latinized when Constantine the Great made Byzantium
the imperial residence in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 330; they called themselves Romans
and spoke Latin. Towards the close of the 4th century the
country was devastated by the Goths and Avars, whose incursions
possessed no lasting significance. It was otherwise with
the great Slavonic immigration, which took place at intervals
from the 3rd to the 7th century. An important ethnographic
change was brought about, and the greater part of Macedonia
was colonized by the invaders (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Balkan Peninsula</a></span>).</p>

<p>The Slavs were in their turn conquered by the Bulgarians
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bulgaria</a></span>: <i>History</i>) whose chief Krum (802-815) included
central Macedonia in his dominions. The Byzantines retained
the southern regions and Salonica, which temporarily fell into
<span class="sidenote">Byzantine and Bulgarian Domination.</span>
the hands of the Saracens in 904. With the exception of the
maritime districts, the whole of Macedonia formed a portion
of the empire of the Bulgarian tsar Simeon (893-927); the
Bulgarian power declined after his death, but was
revived in western Macedonia under the Shishman
dynasty at Ochrida; Tsar Samuel (976-1014), the third
ruler of that family, included in his dominions Usküb,
Veles, Vodena and Melnik. After his defeat by the emperor
Basil II. in 1014 Greek domination was established for a century
and a half. The Byzantine emperors endeavoured to confirm
their positions by Asiatic colonization; Turkish immigrants,
afterwards known as Vardariotes, the first of their race who
appeared in Macedonia, were settled in the neighbourhood of
Salonica in the 9th century; colonies of Uzes, Petchenegs and
Kumans were introduced at various periods from the 11th to the
13th century. While Greeks and Bulgarians disputed the mastery
of Macedonia the Vlachs, in the 10th century, established
an independent state in the Pindus region, which, afterwards
known as Great Walachia, continued to exist till the beginning
of the 14th century. In 1185 southern Macedonia was exposed
to a raid of the Normans under William of Sicily, who captured
Salonica and massacred its inhabitants. After the taking of
Constantinople in 1204 by the Franks of the fourth crusade, the
Latin empire of Romania was formed and the feudal kingdom
of Thessalonica was bestowed on Boniface, marquis of Montferrat;
this was overthrown in 1222 by Theodore, despot of
Epirus, a descendant of the imperial house of the Comneni, who
styled himself emperor of Thessalonica and for some years ruled
over all Macedonia. He was defeated and captured by the
Bulgarians in 1230 and the remnant of his possessions, to which
his son John succeeded, was absorbed in the empire of Nicaea
in 1234. Bulgarian rule was now once more established in Macedonia
under the powerful monarch Ivan Asen II. (1218-1241)
whose dynasty, of Vlach origin, had been founded at Trnovo
in 1186 after a revolt of the Vlachs and Bulgars against the
Greeks. A period of decadence followed the extinction of the
Asen dynasty in 1257; the Bulgarian power was overthrown by
the Servians at Velbuzhd (1330), and Macedonia was included
in the realm of the great Servian tsar Dushan (1331-1355) who
fixed his capital at Usküb. Dushan&rsquo;s empire fell to pieces after
his death, and the anarchy which followed prepared the way for
the advance of the Turks, to whom not only contending
factions at Constantinople but Servian and Bulgarian princes
alike made overtures.</p>

<p>Macedonia and Thrace were soon desolated by Turkish raids;
when it was too late the Slavonic states combined against the
invaders, but their forces, under the Servian tsar
Lazar, were routed at Kossovo in 1389 by the sultan
<span class="sidenote">Turkish Rule.</span>
Murad I. Salonica and Larissa were captured in
1395 by Murad&rsquo;s son Bayezid, whose victory over Sigismund
of Hungary at Nicopolis in 1396 sealed the fate of the
peninsula. The towns in the Struma valley were yielded to
the Turks by John VII. Palaeologus in 1424; Salonica was
taken for the last time in 1428 by Murad II. and its inhabitants
were massacred. Large tracts of land were distributed
among the Ottoman chiefs; a system of feudal tenure was
developed by Mahommed II. (1451-1481), each fief furnishing a
certain number of armed warriors. The Christian peasant
owners remained on the lands assigned to the Moslem feudal
lords, to whom they paid a tithe. The condition of the subject
population was deplorable from the first, and became worse
during the period of anarchy which coincided with the decadence
of the central power in the 17th and 18th centuries; in the latter
half of the 17th century efforts to improve it were made by the
grand viziers Mehemet and Mustafa of the eminent house of
Koprülü. The country was policed by the janissaries (<i>q.v.</i>).
Numbers of the peasant proprietors were ultimately reduced to
serfdom, working as labourers on the farms or <i>tchifliks</i> of the
Moslem beys. Towards the end of the 18th century many of the
local governors became practically independent; western Macedonia
fell under the sway of Ali Pasha of Iannina; at Serres
Ismail Bey maintained an army of 10,000 men and exercised a
beneficent despotism. For more than two centuries Albanian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>221</span>
incursions, often resulting in permanent settlements, added to
the troubles of the Christian population. The reforms embodied
in the Hatt-i-Sherif of Gulhané (1839) and in the Hatt-i-humayun
(1856), in both of which the perfect equality of races and religions
was proclaimed, remained a dead letter; the first &ldquo;Law of the
Vilayets&rdquo; (1864), reforming the local administration, brought
no relief, while depriving the Christian communities of certain
rights which they had hitherto possessed.</p>

<p>In 1876 a conference of the powers at Constantinople proposed
the reorganization of the Bulgarian provinces of Turkey in two
vilayets under Christian governors-general aided by
popular assemblies. The &ldquo;western&rdquo; vilayet, of
<span class="sidenote">European Intervention.<br />
Treaties of San Stefano and Berlin.</span>
which Sofia was to be the capital, included northern,
central and western Macedonia, extending south as
far as Castoria. The <i>projet de règlement</i> elaborated
by the conference was rejected by the Turkish
parliament convoked under the constitution proclaimed on the
23rd of December 1876; the constitution, which was little more
than a device for eluding European intervention, was shortly
afterwards suspended. Under the treaty of San Stefano (March
3, 1878) the whole of Macedonia, except Salonica and the
Chalcidic peninsula, was included in the newly formed principality
of Bulgaria; this arrangement was reversed by the Treaty
of Berlin (July 13) which left Macedonia under Turkish administration
but provided (Art. xxiii.) for the introduction of reforms
analogous to those of the Cretan Organic Statute of 1868.
These reforms were to be drawn up by special commissions, on
which the native element should be largely represented, and the
opinion of the European commission for eastern Rumelia was to be
taken before their promulgation. The Porte, however, prepared
a project of its own, and the commission, taking this as a basis,
drew up the elaborate &ldquo;Law of the Vilayets&rdquo; (Aug. 23, 1880).
The law never received the sultan&rsquo;s sanction, and European
diplomacy proved unequal to the task of securing its adoption.</p>

<p>The Berlin Treaty, by its artificial division of the Bulgarian
race, created the difficult and perplexing &ldquo;Macedonian Question.&rdquo;
The population handed back to Turkish rule never
acquiesced in its fate; its discontent was aggravated
<span class="sidenote">The Macedonian Question.</span>
by the deplorable misgovernment which characterized
the reign of Abdul Hamid II., and its efforts to assert itself,
stimulated by the sympathy of the enfranchised portion of the
race, provoked rival movements on the part of the other Christian
nationalities, each receiving encouragement and material
aid from the adjacent and kindred states. Some insignificant
risings took place in Macedonia after the signature of the Berlin
Treaty, but in the interval between 1878 and 1893 the population
remained comparatively tranquil, awaiting the fulfilment of the
promised reforms.</p>

<p>In 1893, however, a number of secret revolutionary societies
(<i>druzhestva</i>) were set on foot in Macedonia, and in 1894 similar
bodies were organized as legal corporations in Bulgaria.
The fall of Stamboloff in that year and the
<span class="sidenote">Bulgarian Conspiracies.</span>
reconciliation of Bulgaria with Russia encouraged
the revolutionaries in the mistaken belief that Russia would
take steps to revive the provisions of the San Stefano treaty.
In 1895 the &ldquo;Supreme Macedo-Adrianopolitan Committee&rdquo;
(<i>Vrkhoven Makedoni-Odrinski Komitet</i>) was formed at Sofia
and forthwith despatched armed bands into northern Macedonia;
the town of Melnik was occupied for a short time by the revolutionaries
under Boris Sarafoff, but the enterprise ended in failure.
Dispirited by this result, the &ldquo;Vrkhovists,&rdquo; as the revolutionaries
in Bulgaria were generally styled, refrained from any serious
effort for the next five years; the movement was paralysed by
dissensions among the chiefs, and rival parties were formed under
Sarafoff and General Tzoncheff. Meanwhile the &ldquo;Centralist&rdquo;
or local Macedonian societies were welded by two remarkable
men, Damian Grueff and Gotzé Delcheff, into a formidable power
known as the &ldquo;Internal Organization,&rdquo; founded in 1893, which
maintained its own police, held its own tribunals, assessed and
collected contributions, and otherwise exercised an <i>imperium in
imperio</i> throughout the country, which was divided into rayons
or districts, and subdivided into departments and communes,
each with its special staff of functionaries. The Internal Organization,
as a rule, avoided co-operation with the revolutionaries
in Bulgaria; it aimed at the attainment of Macedonian autonomy,
and at first endeavoured, but unsuccessfully, to enlist the
sympathies of the Greeks and Servians for the programme of
&ldquo;Macedonia for the Macedonians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The principle of autonomy was suspected at Athens and
Belgrade as calculated to ensure Bulgarian predominance and
to delay or preclude the ultimate partition of the
country. At Athens, especially, the progress of the
<span class="sidenote">Greek Action.</span>
Bulgarian movement was viewed with much alarm; it was
feared that Macedonia would be lost to Hellenism, and in 1896
the <i>Ethniké Hetaerea</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greece</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Crete</a></span>) sent numerous
bands into the southern districts of the country. The Hetaerea
aimed at bringing about a war between Greece and Turkey, and
the outbreak of trouble in Crete enabled it to accomplish its
purpose. During the Greco-Turkish War (<i>q.v.</i>) Macedonia
remained quiet, Bulgaria and Servia refraining from interference
under pressure from Austria, Russia and the other great powers.
The reverses of the Greeks were to the advantage of the Bulgarian
movement, which continued to gain strength, but after
the discovery of a hidden dépôt of arms at Vinitza in 1897 the
Turkish authorities changed their attitude towards the Bulgarian
element; extreme and often barbarous methods of repression
were adopted, and arms were distributed among the Moslem
population. The capture of an American missionary, Miss
Stone, by a Bulgarian band under Sandansky in the autumn of
1901 proved a windfall to the revolutionaries, who expended her
ransom of £T16,000 in the purchase of arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>In 1902 the Servians, after a prolonged conflict with the Greeks,
succeeded with Russian aid in obtaining the nomination of Mgr.
Firmilian, a Servian, to the archbishopric of Usküb.
Contemporaneously with a series of Russo-Bulgarian
<span class="sidenote">Troubles in 1902: Intervention of the Powers.</span>
celebrations in the Shipka pass in September of that
year, an effort was made to provoke a rising in the
Monastir district by Colonel Yankoff, the lieutenant of General
Tzoncheff; in November a number of bands entered the Razlog
district under the general&rsquo;s personal direction. These movements,
which were not supported by the Internal Organization, ended
in failure, and merciless repression followed. The state of the
country now became such as to necessitate the intervention of
the powers, and the Austrian and Russian governments, which
had acted in concert since April 1897, drew up an elaborate
scheme of reforms. The Porte, as usual, endeavoured to forestall
foreign interference by producing a project of its own,
which was promulgated in November 1902, and Hilmi Pasha
was appointed Inspector General of the Rumelian vilayets and
charged with its application. The two powers, however, persevered
in their intention and on the 21st of February 1903
presented to the Porte an identic memorandum proposing a
series of reforms in the administration, police and finance,
including the employment of &ldquo;foreign specialists&rdquo; for the
reorganization of the gendarmerie.</p>

<p>At the same time the Bulgarian government, under pressure
from Russia, arrested the revolutionary leaders in the principality,
suppressed the committees, and confiscated their
funds. The Internal Organization, however, was beyond
<span class="sidenote">Bulgarian Insurrection in 1903.</span>
reach, and preparations for an insurrection went
rapidly forward. In March a serious Albanian revolt
complicated the situation. At the end of April a number of
dynamite outrages took place at Salonica; public opinion in
Europe turned against the revolutionaries and the Turks seized
the opportunity to wreak a terrible vengeance on the Bulgarian
population. On the 2nd of August, the feast of St Elias, a general
insurrection broke out in the Monastir vilayet, followed by
sporadic revolts in other districts. The insurgents achieved
some temporary successes and occupied the towns of Krushevo,
Klisura and Neveska, but by the end of September their resistance
was overcome; more than 100 villages were burned by the
troops and bashi-bazouks, 8400 houses were destroyed and 60,000
peasants remained homeless in the mountains at the approach of
winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>222</span></p>

<p>The Austrian and Russian governments then drew up a
further series of reforms known as the &ldquo;Mürzsteg programme&rdquo;
(Oct. 9, 1903) to which the Porte assented in principle,
though many difficulties were raised over
<span class="sidenote">The &ldquo;Mürzsteg Programme.&rdquo;</span>
details. Two officials, an Austrian and a Russian,
styled &ldquo;civil agents&rdquo; and charged with the supervision
of the local authorities in the application of reforms,
were placed by the side of the inspector-general while the
reorganization of the gendarmerie was entrusted to a foreign
general in the Turkish service aided by a certain number of
officers from the armies of the great powers. The latter task
was entrusted to the Italian General de Giorgis (April 1904),
the country being divided into sections under the supervision
of the officers of each power. The reforms proved a failure,
mainly owing to the tacit opposition of the Turkish authorities,
the insufficient powers attributed to the European
officials, the racial feuds and the deplorable financial situation.
In 1905 the powers agreed on the establishment of a financial
commission on which the representatives of Great Britain,
France, Germany and Italy would sit as colleagues of the civil
agents. The Porte offered an obstinate resistance to the
project and only yielded (Dec. 5) when the fleets of the powers
appeared near the Dardanelles. Some improvement was now
effected in the financial administration, but the general state of
the country continued to grow worse; large funds were collected
abroad by the committees at Athens, which despatched numerous
bands largely composed of Cretans into the southern districts,
the Servians displayed renewed activity in the north, while the
Bulgarians offered a dogged resistance to all their foes.</p>

<p>The Austro-Russian <i>entente</i> came to an end in the beginning
of 1908 owing to the Austrian project of connecting the Bosnian
and Macedonian railway systems, and Great Britain
and Russia now took the foremost place in the
<span class="sidenote">The &ldquo;Reval Programme.&rdquo;</span>
demand for reforms. After a meeting between King
Edward VII. and the emperor Nicholas II. at Reval in the early
summer of 1908 an Anglo-Russian scheme, known as the &ldquo;Reval
programme,&rdquo; was announced; the project aimed at more effective
European supervision and dealt especially with the administration
of justice. Its appearance was almost immediately followed
by the military revolt of the Young Turk or constitutional party,
which began in the Monastir district under two junior officers,
Enver Bey and Niazi Bey, in July. The restoration of the constitution
of 1876 was proclaimed (July 24,1908), and the powers,
anticipating the spontaneous adoption of reforms on the part of
regenerated Turkey, decided to suspend the Reval programme
and to withdraw their military officers from Macedonia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACEDONIAN EMPIRE,<a name="ar168" id="ar168"></a></span> the name generally given to the
empire founded by Alexander the Great of Macedon in the
countries now represented by Greece and European Turkey,
Asia Minor, Egypt, Syria, Persia and eastwards as far as northern
India.<a name="fa1t" id="fa1t" href="#ft1t"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The present article contains a general account of the
empire in its various aspects. It falls naturally into two main
divisions:&mdash;I. The reign of Alexander. II. The period of his
successors, the &ldquo;Diadochi&rdquo; and their dynasties.</p>

<p>I. <i>The Reign of Alexander.</i>&mdash;At the beginning of the 4th
century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> two types of political association confronted each
other in the lands of the Eastern Mediterranean,&mdash;the
Persian monarchy with its huge agglomeration
<span class="sidenote">1. Greeks and Persians.</span>
of subject peoples, and the Greek city-state. Each
had a different principle of strength. The Persian monarchy was
strong in its size, in the mere amount of men and treasure it could
dispose of under a single hand; the Greek state was strong in its
<i>morale</i>, in the energy and discipline of its soldiery. But the
smallness of the single city-states and their unwillingness to
combine prevented this superiority in quality from telling
destructively upon the bulk of the Persian empire. The future
belonged to any power that could combine the advantages of
both systems, could make a state larger than the Greek <i>polis</i>,
and animated by a spirit equal to that of the Greek soldier. This
was achieved by the kings of Macedonia. The work, begun by
his predecessors, of consolidating the kingdom internally and
making its army a fighting-machine of high power was completed
by the genius of Philip II. (359-336 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), who at the same
time by war and diplomacy brought the Greek states of the
Balkan peninsula generally to recognize his single predominance.
At the synod of Corinth (338) Philip was solemnly declared the
captain-general (<span class="grk" title="stratêgos autokratôr">&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#8056;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#961;</span>) of the Hellenes against
the Great King. The attack on Persia was delayed by the
assassination of Philip in 336, and it needed some fighting before
the young Alexander had made his position secure in Macedonia
and Greece. The recognition as captain-general he had obtained
at another synod in Corinth, by an imposing military demonstration
in Greece immediately upon his accession. Then came the
invasion of the Persian empire by Alexander in 334 at the head
of an army composed both of Macedonians and contingents from
the allied Greek states. Before this force the Persian monarchy
went down, and when Alexander died eleven years later (323) a
Macedonian empire which covered all the territory of the old
Persian empire, and even more, was a realized fact.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The empire outside of Macedonia itself consisted of 22 provinces.
<i>In Europe</i>, (1) Thrace; <i>in Asia Minor</i>, (2) Phrygia on the Hellespont,
(3) Lydia, (4) Caria, (5) Lycia and Pamphylia, (6) Great
Phrygia, (7) Paphlagonia and Cappadocia;
<span class="sidenote">2. Extent of the Empire.</span>
<i>between the Taurus and Iran</i>, (8) Cilicia, (9) Syria, (10) Mesopotamia,
(11) Babylonia, (12) Susiana; <i>in Africa</i>, (13) Egypt; <i>in Iran</i>,
(14) Persis, (15) Media, (16) Parthia and Hyrcania, (17) Bactria and
Sogdiana, (18) Areia and Drangiana, (19) Carmania, (20) Arachosia
and Gedrosia; lastly <i>the Indian provinces</i>, (21) the Paropanisidae (the
Kabul valley), and (22) the province assigned to Pithon, the son of
Agenor, upon the Indus (J. Beloch, <i>Griech. Gesch.</i> III. [ii.], p. 236 seq.;
for the Indian provinces cf. B. Niese, <i>Gesch. der griech. und maked.
Staaten</i>, I. p. 500 seq.). Hardly provinces proper, but rather client
principalities, were the two native kingdoms to which Alexander had
left the conquered land beyond the Indus&mdash;the kingdoms of Taxiles
and Porus.</p>
</div>

<p>The conquered empire presented Alexander with a system of
government ready-made, which it was natural for the new masters
to take over. For the Asiatic provinces and Egypt, the old
Persian name of <i>satrapy</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Satrap</a></span>) was still retained,
<span class="sidenote">3. System of Government.</span>
but the governor seems to have been styled
officially in Greek <i>strategos</i>, although the term <i>satrap</i>
certainly continued current in common parlance. The governors
appointed by Alexander were, in the west of the empire,
exclusively Macedonians; in the east, members of the Old Persian
nobility were still among the satraps at Alexander&rsquo;s death,
Atropates in Media, Phrataphernes in Parthia and Hyrcania,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span>
and Alexander&rsquo;s father-in-law Oxyartes in the Paropanisidae.
Alexander had at first trusted Persian grandees more freely in
this capacity; in Babylonia, Bactria, Carmania, Susiana he had
set Persian governors, till the ingrained Oriental tradition of
misgovernment so declared itself that to the three latter provinces
certainly Macedonians had been appointed before his death.
Otherwise the only eastern satrapy whose governor was not a
Macedonian, was Areia, under Stasanor, a Cypriote Greek. In
the case of certain provinces, possibly in the empire generally,
Alexander established a double control. The financial administration
was entrusted to separate officials; we hear of such in
Lydia (Arr. i. 17, 7), Babylonia (id. iii. 16, 4), and notably in
Egypt (id. iii. 5, 4). Higher financial controllers seem to have
been over groups of provinces (Philoxenus over Asia Minor, Arr.
i. 17, 7; see Beloch, <i>Gr. Gesch.</i> III. [i] p. 14), and Harpalus over
the whole finances of the empire, with his seat in Babylon. Again
the garrisons in the chief cities, such as Sardis, Babylon, Memphis
Pelusium and Susa, were under commands distinct from those
of the provinces. The old Greek cities of the motherland were
not formally subjects of the empire, but sovereign states, which
assembled at Corinth as members of a great alliance, in which
the Macedonian king was included as a member and held the
office of captain-general. The Greek cities of Asia Minor stood
to him in a similar relation, though not included in the Corinthian
alliance, but in federations of their own (Kaerst, <i>Gesch. d.
hellenist. Zeitalt.</i> i. 261 seq.). Their territory was not part of the
king&rsquo;s country (<i>Inscr. in the Brit. Mus.</i> No. 400). Of course, in
fact, the power of the king was so vastly superior that the Greek
cities were in reality subject to his dictation, even in so intimate
a matter as the readmission of their exiles, and might be obliged
to receive his garrisons. Within the empire itself, the various
communities were allowed, subject to the interference of the king
or his officials, to manage their own affairs. Alexander is said
to have granted the Lydians to be &ldquo;free&rdquo; and &ldquo;to use the laws
of the ancient Lydians,&rdquo; whatever exactly these expressions
may mean (Arr. i. 17, 4). So too in Egypt, the native monarchs
were left as the local authorities (Arr. iii. 5, 4). Especially to
the gods of the conquered people Alexander showed respect. In
Egypt and in Babylon he appeared as the restorer of the native
religions to honour after the unsympathetic rule of the Persians.
The temple of Marduk in Babylon which had fallen began to rise
again at his command. It is possible that he offered sacrifice
to Yahweh in Jerusalem. In Persia, the native aristocracy
retained their power, and the Macedonian governor adopted
Persian dress and manners (Diod. xix. 48, 5; Arr. vi. 30). A
new factor introduced by Alexander was the foundation of Greek
cities at all critical points of intercourse in the conquered lands.
These, no doubt, possessed municipal autonomy with the ordinary
organization of the Greek state; to what extent they were formally
and regularly controlled by the provincial authorities we do not
know; Pithon, the satrap of the Indian province is specially
described as sent &ldquo;in colonias in Indis conditas&rdquo; (Just. xiii.
4, 21). The empire included large tracts of mountain or desert,
inhabited by tribes, which the Persian government had never
subdued. The subjugation of such districts could only be by a
system of effective military occupation and would be a work of
time; but Alexander made a beginning by punitive expeditions,
as occasion offered, calculated to reduce the free tribes to temporary
quiet; we hear of such expeditions in the case of the Pisidians,
the tribes of the Lebanon, the Uxii (in Khuzistan), the Tapyri (in
the Elburz), the hill-peoples of Bajaor and Swat, the Cossaei
(in Kurdistan); an expedition against the Arabs was in preparation
when Alexander died.</p>

in Klio</i>, v. 303 seq. (1905).</p>
</div>

<p>Alexander, who set out as king of the Macedonians and captain-general
of the Hellenes, assumed after the death of Darius the
character of the Oriental great king. He adopted
the Persian garb (Plutarch, <i>de fort. Al.</i> i. 8) including
<span class="sidenote">4. Court.</span>
a head-dress, the <i>diadema</i>, which was suggested by
that of the Achaemenian king (<i>Just.</i> xii. 3, 8). We hear
also of a sceptre as part of his insignia (<i>Diod.</i> xviii. 27, 1).
The pomps and ceremonies which were traditional in the East
were to be continued. To the Greeks and Macedonians such a
régime was abhorrent, and the opposition roused by Alexander&rsquo;s
attempt to introduce among them the practice of <i>proskynesis</i>
(prostration before the royal presence), was bitter and effectual.
The title of <i>chiliarch</i>, by which the Greeks had described the
great king&rsquo;s chief minister, in accordance with the Persian title
which described him as &ldquo;commander of a thousand,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> of the
royal body-guard, was conferred by Alexander upon his friend
Hephaestion. The Greek Chares held the position of chief usher
(<span class="grk" title="eisangeleus">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#973;&#962;</span>). Another Greek, Eumenes of Cardia, was chief
secretary (<span class="grk" title="archigrammateus">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#953;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#962;</span>). The figure of the eunuch, so long
characteristic of the Oriental court, was as prominent as ever
(<i>e.g.</i> Bagoas, Plut. <i>Alex.</i> 67, &amp;c.; cf. Arr. vii. 24).</p>

<p>Alexander, however, who impressed his contemporaries by
his sexual continence, kept no harem of the old sort. The
number of his wives did not go beyond two, and the second, the
daughter of Darius, he did not take till a year before his death.
In closest contact with the king&rsquo;s person were the seven, or
latterly eight, body-guards, <span class="grk" title="sômatophylakes">&#963;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#966;&#973;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#962;</span>, Macedonians of high
rank, including Ptolemy and Lysimachus, the future kings of
Egypt, and Thrace (Arr. vi. 28, 4). The institution, which the
Macedonian court before Alexander had borrowed from Persia,
of a corps of pages composed of the young sons of the nobility
(<span class="grk" title="paides basileioi">&#960;&#945;&#8150;&#948;&#949;&#962; &#946;&#945;&#963;&#943;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#953;</span> or <span class="grk" title="basilikoi">&#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#943;</span>) continued to hold an important
place in the system of the court and in Alexander&rsquo;s campaigns
(see Arr. iv. 13, 1; Curt. viii. 6, 6; Suid. <span class="grk" title="basileioi paides">&#946;&#945;&#963;&#943;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#953; &#960;&#945;&#8150;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span>; cf.
the <span class="grk" title="paides">&#960;&#945;&#8150;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span> of Eumenes, Diod. xix. 28, 3).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>See Spiecker, <i>Der Hof und die Hofordnung Alex. d. Grossen</i> (1904).</p>

<p>The army of Alexander was an instrument which he inherited
from his father Philip. Its core was composed of the Macedonian
peasantry who served on foot in heavy armour (&ldquo;the
Foot-companions&rdquo; <span class="grk" title="pezetairoi">&#960;&#949;&#950;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#8150;&#961;&#959;&#953;</span>). They formed the phalanx,
<span class="sidenote">5. Army.</span>
and were divided into 6 brigades (<span class="grk" title="taxeis">&#964;&#940;&#958;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>), probably on the territorial
system. Their distinctive arm was the great Macedonian pike
(<i>sarissa</i>), some 14 ft. long, of further reach than the ordinary Greek
spear. They were normally drawn up in more open order than the
heavy Greek phalanx, and possessed thereby a mobility and elasticity
in which the latter was fatally deficient. Reckoning 1,500 to each
brigade, we got a total for the phalanx of 9,000 men. Of higher rank
than the <i>pezetaeri</i> were the royal foot-guards (<span class="grk" title="basilikoi hypaspistai">&#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8054; &#8016;&#960;&#945;&#963;&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>),
some 3,000 in number, more lightly armed, and distinguished (at any
rate at the time of Alexander&rsquo;s death) by silver shields. Of these
1,000 constituted the royal corps (<span class="grk" title="to agêma to basilikou">&#964;&#8056; &#7940;&#947;&#951;&#956;&#945; &#964;&#8056; &#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;</span>). The Macedonian
cavalry was recruited from a higher grade of society than the
infantry, the <i>petite noblesse</i> of the nation. They bore by old custom
the name of the king&rsquo;s Companions (<span class="grk" title="hetairoi">&#7953;&#964;&#945;&#8150;&#961;&#959;&#953;</span>), and were distributed
into 8 territorial squadrons (<span class="grk" title="ilai">&#7988;&#955;&#945;&#953;</span>) of probably some 250 men each,
making a normal total of 2,000. In the cavalry also the most
privileged squadron bore the name of the <i>agema</i>. The ruder peoples
which were neighbors to the Macedonians (Paeonians, Agrianes,
Thracians) furnished contingents of light cavalry and javelineers
(<span class="grk" title="akontistai">&#7936;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#943;</span>). From the Thessalians the Macedonian king, as overlord,
drew some thousand excellent troopers. The rest of Alexander&rsquo;s
army was composed of Greeks, not formally his subjects. These
served partly as mercenaries, partly in contingents contributed
by the states in virtue of their alliance. According to Diodorus
(xvii. 17, 3) at the time of Alexander&rsquo;s passage into Asia, the mercenaries
numbered 5,000, and the troops of the alliance 7,000 foot
and 600 horse. All these numbers take no account of the troops
left behind in Macedonia, 12,000 foot and 1,500 horse, according to
Diodorus. When Alexander was lord of Asia, innovations followed
in the army. Already in 330 at Persepolis, the command went forth
that 30,000 young Asiatics were to be trained as Macedonian soldiers
(the <i>epigoni</i>, Arr. vii., 6, 1). Contingents of the fine Bactrian
cavalry followed Alexander into India. Persian nobles were admitted
into the <i>agema</i> of the Macedonian cavalry. A far more radical remodelling
of the army was undertaken at Babylon in 323, by which the
old phalanx system was to be given up for one in which the unit was
to be composed of Macedonians with pikes and Asiatics with missile
arms in combination&mdash;a change calculated to be momentous both
from a military point of view in the coming wars, and from a political,
in the close fusion of Europeans and Asiatics. The death of Alexander
interrupted the scheme, and his successors reverted to the
older system. In the wars of Alexander the phalanx was never
the most active arm; Alexander delivered his telling attacks with
his cavalry, whereas the slow-moving phalanx held rather the position
of a reserve, and was brought up to complete a victory when
the cavalry charges had already taken effect. Apart from the
pitched battles, the warfare of Alexander was largely hill-fighting,
in which the <i>hypaspistae</i> took the principal part, and the contingents
of light-armed hillmen from the Balkan region did excellent service.</p>

</div>

<p>The modifications in the army system were closely connected
with Alexander&rsquo;s general policy, in which the fusion of Greeks
and Asiatics held so prominent a place. He had
himself, as we have seen, assumed to some extent
<span class="sidenote">6. Fusion of Greeks and Asiatics.</span>
the guise of a Persian king. The Macedonian
Peucestas received special marks of his favour for adopting the
Persian dress. The most striking declaration of his ideals was
the marriage feast at Susa in 324, when a large number of the
Macedonian nobles were induced to marry Persian princesses,
and the rank and file were encouraged by special rewards to take
Eastern wives. We are told that among the schemes registered
in the state papers and disclosed after Alexander&rsquo;s death was
one for transplanting large bodies of Asiatics into Europe and
Europeans into Asia, for blending the peoples of the empire by
intermarriage into a single whole (Diod. xviii. 4, 4). How far
did Alexander intend that in such a fusion Hellenic culture should
retain its pre-eminence? How far could it have done so, had
the scheme been realized? It is not impossible that the question
may yet be raised again whether the Eurasian after all is the heir
of the ages.</p>

<p>High above all the medley of kindreds and tongues, untrammelled
by national traditions, for he had outgrown the
compass of any one nation, invested with the
glory of achievements in which the old bounds of
<span class="sidenote">7. Divine Honours.</span>
the possible seemed to fall away, stood in 324 the
man Alexander. Was he a man? The question was explicitly
suggested by the report that the Egyptian priest in the Oasis
had hailed him in the god&rsquo;s name as the son of Ammon. The
Egyptians had, of course, ascribed deity by old custom to their
kings, and were ready enough to add Alexander to the list. The
Persians, on the other hand, had a different conception of the
godhead, and we have no proof that from them Alexander either
required or received divine honours. From the Greeks he certainly
received such honours; the ambassadors from the Greek
states came in 323 with the character of <i>theori</i>, as if approaching
a deity (Arr. vii. 23, 2). It has been supposed that in offering
such worship the Greeks showed the effect of &ldquo;Oriental&rdquo;
influence, but indeed we have not to look outside the Greek circle
of ideas to explain it. As early as Aeschylus (<i>Supp.</i> 991) the
proffering of divine honours was a form of expression for intense
feelings of reverence or gratitude towards men which naturally
suggested itself&mdash;as a figure of speech in Aeschylus, but the figure
had been translated into action before Alexander not in the well-known
case of Lysander only (cf. the case of Dion, Plut. <i>Dio</i>, 29).
Among the educated Greeks rationalistic views of the old
mythology had become so current that they could assimilate
Alexander to Dionysus without supposing him to be supernatural,
and to this temper the divine honours were a mere form,
an elaborate sort of flattery. Did Alexander merely receive such
honours? Or did he claim them himself? It would seem that
he did. Many of the assertions as to his action in this line do
not stand the light of criticism (see Hogarth, <i>Eng. Hist. Rev.</i> ii.,
1887, p. 317 seq.; Niese, <i>Historische Zeitschrift</i>, lxxix., 1897, p. 1,
seq.); even the explicit Statement in Arrian as to Alexander
and the Arabians is given as a mere report; but we have well-authenticated
utterances of Attic orators when the question of
the cult of Alexander came up for debate, which seem to prove
that an intimation of the king&rsquo;s pleasure had been conveyed to
Athens.</p>

<p>A new life entered the lands conquered by Alexander. Human
intercourse was increased and quickened to a degree not before
known. Commercial enterprise now found open
roads between the Aegean and India; the new
<span class="sidenote">8. Intercourse and Discovery.</span>
Greek cities made stations in what had been for
the earlier Greek traders unknown lands; an immense quantity
of precious metal had been put into circulation which
the Persian kings had kept locked up in their treasuries
(cf. Athen, vi. 231 e). At the same time Alexander himself made
it a principal concern to win fresh geographical knowledge, to
open new ways. The voyage of Nearchus from the Indus to the
Euphrates was intended to link India by a waterway with the
Mediterranean lands. So too Heraclides was sent to explore
the Caspian; the survey, and possible circumnavigation, of the
Arabian coasts was the last enterprise which occupied Alexander.
The improvement of waterways in the interior of the empire was
not neglected, the Babylonian canal system was repaired, the
obstructions in the Tigris removed. A canal was attempted
across the Mimas promontory (Plin. <i>N.H.</i> v. 116). The reports
of the <span class="grk" title="Bêmatistai">&#946;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#943;</span>, Baeton and Diognetus, who accompanied
the march of Alexander&rsquo;s army, gave an exacter knowledge of
the geographical conformation of the empire, and were accessible
for later investigators (Susemihl, <i>Gesch. d. griech. Litt.</i>, I. p. 544).
Greek natural science was enriched with a mass of new material
from the observations of the philosophers who went with
Alexander through the strange lands (H. Bretzl, <i>Botanische
Forschungen d. Alexanderzuges</i>, 1903); whilst on the other hand
attempts were made to acclimatize the plants of the motherland
in the foreign soil (Theophr., <i>Hist. Plant.</i> iv. 4, 1).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The accession of Alexander brought about a change in the monetary
system of the kingdom. Philip&rsquo;s bimetallic system, which had
attempted artificially to fix the value of silver in spite
of the great depreciation of gold consequent upon the
<span class="sidenote">9. Coinage.</span>
working of the Pangaean mines, was abandoned. Alexander&rsquo;s
gold coinage, indeed (possibly not struck till after the invasion of
Asia), follows in weight that of Philip&rsquo;s staters; but he seems at
once to have adopted for his silver coins (of a smaller denomination
than the tetradrachm) the Euboic-Attic standard, instead of the
Phoenician, which had been Philip&rsquo;s. With the conquest of Asia,
Alexander conceived the plan of issuing a uniform coinage for the
empire. Gold had fallen still further from the diffusion of the Persian
treasure, and Alexander struck in both metals on the Attic
standard, leaving their relation to adjust itself by the state of the
market. This imperial coinage was designed to break down the
monetary predominance of Athens (Beloch, <i>Gr. Gesch.</i> iii. [i.], 42).
None of the coins with Alexander&rsquo;s own image can be shown to have
been issued during his reign; the traditional gods of the Greeks
still admitted no living man to share their prerogative in this sphere.
Athena and Nike alone figured upon Alexander&rsquo;s gold; Heracles and
Zeus upon his silver.</p>

<p>II. <i>After Alexander.</i>&mdash;The external fortunes of the Macedonian
Empire after Alexander&rsquo;s death must be briefly traced before its
inner developments be touched upon.<a name="fa2t" id="fa2t" href="#ft2t"><span class="sp">2</span></a> There was, at
first, when Alexander suddenly died in 323, no overt
<span class="sidenote">1. History of the &ldquo;Successors.&rdquo;</span>
disruption of the empire. The dispute between
the Macedonian infantry and the cavalry (<i>i.e.</i> the
commonalty and the nobles) was as to the person who should
be chosen to be the king, although it is true that either candidate,
the half-witted son of Philip II., Philip Arrhidaeus, or the posthumous
son of Alexander by Roxana, opened the prospect of a
long regency exercised by one or more of the Macedonian lords.
The compromise, by which both the candidates should be kings
together, was, of course, succeeded by a struggle for power
among those who wished to rule in their name. The resettlement
of dignities made in Babylon in 323, while it left the eastern
commands practically undisturbed as well as that of Antipater
in Europe, placed Perdiccas (whether as regent or as chiliarch) in
possession of the kings&rsquo; persons, and this was a position which
the other Macedonian lords could not suffer. Hence the first
intestine war among the Macedonians, in which Antipater,
Antigonus, the satrap of Phrygia, and Ptolemy, the satrap of
Egypt, were allied against Perdiccas, who was ultimately murdered
in 321 on the Egyptian frontier (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Perdiccas</a></span> [4],
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Eumenes</a></span>). A second settlement, made at Triparadisus in
Syria in 321, constituted Antipater regent and increased the
power of Antigonus in Asia. When Antipater died, in 319, a
second war broke out, the wrecks of the party of Perdiccas, led
by Eumenes, combining with Polyperchon, the new regent, and
later on (318) with the eastern satraps who were in arms against
Pithon, the satrap of Media. Cassander, the son of Antipater,
disappointed of the regency, had joined the party of Antigonus.
In 316 Antigonus had defeated and killed Eumenes and made
himself supreme from the Aegean to Iran, and Cassander had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>
ousted Polyperchon from Macedonia. But now a third war
began, the old associates of Antigonus, alarmed by his overgrown
power, combining against him&mdash;Cassander, Ptolemy,
Lysimachus, the governor of Thrace, and Seleucus, who had fled
before Antigonus from his satrapy of Babylonia. From 315 to
301 the war of Antigonus against these four went on, with one
short truce in 311. Antigonus never succeeded in reaching
Macedonia, although his son Demetrius won Athens and Megara
in 307 and again (304-302) wrested almost all Greece from
Cassander; nor did Antigonus succeed in expelling Ptolemy from
Egypt, although he led an army to its frontier in 306; and after
the battle of Gaza in 312, in which Ptolemy and Seleucus defeated
Demetrius, he had to see Seleucus not only recover Babylonia
but bring all the eastern provinces under his authority as far as
India. Meanwhile the struggle changed its character in an
important respect. King Philip had been murdered by Olympias
in 317; the young Alexander by Cassander in 310; Heracles, the
illegitimate son of Alexander the Great, by Polyperchon in 309.
Thus the old royal house became extinct in the male line, and in
306 Antigonus assumed the title of king. His four adversaries
answered this challenge by immediately doing the same. Even
in appearance the empire was no longer a unity. In 301 the
coalition triumphed over Antigonus in the battle of Ipsus (in
Phrygia) and he himself was slain. Of the four kings who now
divided the Macedonian Empire amongst them, two were not
destined to found durable dynasties, while the house of Antigonus,
represented by Demetrius, was after all to do so. The house of
Antipater came to an end in the male line in 294, when Demetrius
killed the son of Cassander and established himself on the throne
of Macedonia. He was however expelled by Lysimachus and
Pyrrhus in 288; and in 285 Lysimachus took possession of all the
European part of the Macedonian Empire. Except indeed for
Egypt and Palestine under Ptolemy, Lysimachus and Seleucus
now divided the empire between them, with the Taurus in Asia
Minor for their frontier. These two survivors of the forty years&rsquo;
conflict soon entered upon the crowning fight, and in 281
Lysimachus fell in the battle of Corupedion (in Lydia), leaving
Seleucus virtually master of the empire. Seleucus&rsquo; assassination
by Ptolemy Ceraunus in the same year brought back confusion.</p>

<p>Ptolemy Ceraunus (the son of the first Ptolemy, and half-brother
of the reigning king of Egypt) seized the Macedonian
throne, whilst Antiochus, the son of Seleucus, succeeded in holding
together the Asiatic dominions of his father. The confusion
was aggravated by the incursion of the Gauls into the Balkan
Peninsula in 279; Ptolemy Ceraunus perished, and a period of
complete anarchy succeeded in Macedonia. In 276 Antigonus
Gonatas, the son of Demetrius, after inflicting a crushing defeat
on the Gauls near Lysimachia, at last won Macedonia definitively
for his house. Three solid kingdoms had thus emerged from all
the fighting since Alexander&rsquo;s death: the kingdom of the
Antigonids in the original land of the race, the kingdom of the
Ptolemies in Egypt, and that of the Seleucids, extending from
the Aegean to India. For the next 100 years these are the three
great powers of the eastern Mediterranean. But already parts
of the empire of Alexander had passed from Macedonian rule
altogether. In Asia Minor, Philetaerus a Greek of Tios (Tieium)
in Paphlagonia, had established himself in a position of practical
independence at Pergamum, and his nephew, Attalus, was the
father of the line of kings who reigned in Pergamum till 133&mdash;antagonistic
to the Seleucid house, till in 189 they took over the
Seleucid possessions west of the Taurus. In Bithynia a native
dynasty assumed the style of kings in 297. In Cappadocia two
Persian houses, relics of the old aristocracy of Achaemenian days
had carved out principalities, one of which became the kingdom
of Pontus and the other the kingdom of Cappadocia (in the
narrower sense); the former regarding Mithradates (281-266)
as its founder, the latter being the creation of the second Ariarathes
(?302-?281). Armenia, never effectively conquered by
the Macedonians, was left in the hands of native princes, tributary
only when the Seleucid court was strong enough to compel.
In India, Seleucus had in 302 ceded large districts on the west
of the Indus to Chandragupta, who had arisen to found a
native empire which annexed the Macedonian provinces in the
Panjab.</p>

<p>Whilst the Antigonid kingdom remained practically whole till
the Roman conquest ended it in 168 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and the house of
Ptolemy ruled in Egypt till the death of Cleopatra in 30 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, the
Seleucid Empire perished by a slow process of disruption. The
eastern provinces of Iran went in 240 or thereabouts, when the
Greek Diodotus made himself an independent king in Bactria (<i>q.v.</i>)
and Sogdiana, and Tiridates, brother of Arsaces, a &ldquo;Scythian&rdquo;
chieftain, conquered Parthia (so Arrian, but see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Parthia</a></span>).
Armenia was finally lost in 190, when Artaxias founded a new
native dynasty there. Native princes probably ruled in Persis
before 166, though the district was at least nominally subject
to Antiochus IV. Epiphanes till his death in 164 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Persis</a></span>).
In southern Syria, which had been won by the house of Seleucus
from the house of Ptolemy in 198, the independent Jewish
principality was set up in 143. About the same time Media was
totally relinquished to the Parthians. Babylonia was Parthian
from 129. Before 88 the Parthians had conquered Mesopotamia.
Commagene was independent under a king, Mithradates Callinicus,
in the earlier part of the last century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Syria itself in the last
days of the Seleucid dynasty is seen to be breaking up into
petty principalities, Greek or native. From 83 to 69 is the
transient episode of Armenian conquest, and in 64 the last
shadow of Seleucid rule vanished, when Syria was made a
Roman province by Pompey. From this time Rome formally
entered upon the heritage of Alexander as far as the Euphrates,
but many of the dynasties which had arisen in the days of Macedonian
supremacy were allowed to go on for a time as client
states. One of them, the royal house of Commagene, not
deposed by the Romans till <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 72, had Seleucid blood in its
veins through the marriage of a Seleucid princess with Mithradates
Callinicus, and regarded itself as being a continuation of
the Seleucid dynasty. Its kings bore the name of Antiochus,
and were as proud of their Macedonian, as of their Persian,
descent (see the Inscription of Nimrud Dagh, Michel, No. 735).</p>

<p>The Macedonians of Alexander were not mistaken in seeing
an essential transformation of their national monarchy when
Alexander adopted the guise of an Oriental great
king. Transplanted into this foreign soil, the
<span class="sidenote">2. Constitution of the Macedonian Kingdom.</span>
monarchy became an absolute despotism, unchecked
by a proud territorial nobility and a hardy peasantry
on familiar terms with their king. The principle which Seleucus
is reported to have enunciated, that the king&rsquo;s command was the
supreme law (App. <i>Syr.</i> 61), was literally the principle of the new
Hellenistic monarchies in the East. But the rights belonging
to the Macedonian army as Alexander inherited it did not altogether
disappear. Like the old Roman people, the Macedonian
people under arms had acted especially in the transference of the
royal authority, conferring or confirming the right of the new
chief, and in cases of the capital trials of Macedonians. In the
latter respect the army came regularly into function under
Alexander, and in the wars which followed his death (Diod. xviii.
4, 3; 36, 7; 37, 2, 39, 2; xix. 61, 3), and in Macedonia; although
the power of life and death came <i>de facto</i> into the hands of the
Antigonid king, the old right of the army to act as judge was
not legally abrogated, and friction was sometimes caused by its
assertion (Polyb. v. 27, 5). The right of the army to confer the
royal power was still symbolized in the popular acclamation
required on the accession of a new king, and at Alexandria in
troubled times we hear of &ldquo;the people&rdquo; making its will effective
in filling the throne, although it is here hard to distinguish mob-rule
from the exercise of a legitimate function. Thus the people
put Euergetes II. on the throne when Philometor was captured
(Polyb. xxix. 23, 4); the people compelled Cleopatra III. to
choose Soter II. as her associate (Just. xxxiv. 3, 2). In Syria,
the usurper Tryphon bases his right upon an election by the
&ldquo;people&rdquo; (Just. xxxvi. 1, 7) or &ldquo;the army&rdquo; (Jos. <i>Ant.</i> xiii. § 219).
Where it is a case of delegating some part of the supreme authority,
as when Seleucus I. made his son Antiochus king for
the eastern provinces, we find the army convoked to ratify the
appointment (App. <i>Syr.</i> 61). So too the people is spoken of as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>
appointing the guardians of a king during his minority (Just.
xxxiv. 3, 6). Nor was the power of the army a fiction. The
Hellenistic monarchies rested, as all government in the last
resort must, upon the loyalty of those who wielded the brute
force of the state, and however unlimited the powers of the
king might be in theory, he could not alienate the goodwill of
the army with impunity. The right of primogeniture in succession
was recognized as a general principle; a woman, however,
might succeed only so long as there were no male agnates.
Illegitimate children had no rights of succession. In disturbed
times, of course, right yielded to might or to practical necessities.</p>

<p>The practice by which the king associated a son with himself,
as secondary king, dates from the very beginning of the kingdoms
of the Successors; Antigonus on assuming the diadem in 306
caused Demetrius also to bear the title of king. Some ten years
later Seleucus appointed Antiochus as king for the eastern
provinces. Thenceforth the practice is a common one. But
the cases of it fall into two classes. Sometimes the subordinate
or joint kingship implies real functions. In the Seleucid kingdom
the territorial expanse of the realm made the creation of a
distinct subordinate government for part of it a measure of
practical convenience. Sometimes the joint-king is merely
titular, an infant of tender years, as for instance Antiochus
Eupator, the son of Antiochus Epiphanes, or Ptolemy Eupator,
the son of Ptolemy Philometor. The object here is to secure
the succession in the event of the supreme king&rsquo;s dying whilst
his heir is an infant. The king&rsquo;s government was carried on
by officials appointed by him and responsible to him alone.
Government at the same time, as an Oriental despotism understands
it, often has little in view but the gathering in of the
tribute and compulsion of the subjects to personal service in the
army or in royal works, and if satisfied in these respects will leave
much independence to the local authorities. In the loosely-knit
Seleucid realm it is plain that a great deal more independence
was left to the various communities,&mdash;cities or native tribes,&mdash;than
in Egypt, where the conditions made a bureaucratic system
so easy to carry through. In their outlying possessions the
Ptolemies may have suffered as much local independence as the
Seleucids; the internal government of Jerusalem, for instance,
was left to the high priests. In so far as the older Greek cities
fell within their sphere of power, the successors of Alexander
were forced to the same ambiguous policy as Alexander had been,
between recognizing the cities&rsquo; unabated claim to sovereign
independence and the necessity of attaching them securely. In
Asia Minor, the &ldquo;enslavement&rdquo; and liberation of cities alternated
with the circumstances of the hour, while the kings all through
professed themselves the champions of Hellenic freedom, and
were ready on occasion to display munificence toward the city
temples or in public works, such as might reconcile republicans
to a position of dependence. Antiochus III. went so far as to
write on one occasion to the subject Greek cities that if any royal
mandate clashed with the civic laws it was to be disregarded
(Plut. <i>Imp. et duc. apophth.</i>). But it was the old cry of the
&ldquo;autonomy of the Hellenes,&rdquo; raised by Smyrna and Lampsacus,
which ultimately brought Antiochus III. into collision with
Rome. How anxious the Pergamene kings, with their ardent
Hellenism, were to avoid offence is shown by the elaborate forms
by which, in their own capital, they sought to give their real
control the appearance of popular freedom (Cardinali, Regno di
<i>Pergamo</i>, p. 281 seq.). A similar problem confronted the Antigonid
dynasty in the cities of Greece itself, for to maintain a predominant
influence in Greece was a ground-principle of their policy.
Demetrius had presented himself in 307 as the liberator, and
driven the Macedonian garrison from the Peiraeus; but his own
garrisons held Athens thirteen years later, when he was king of
Macedonia, and the Antigonid dynasty clung to the points of
vantage in Greece, especially Chalcis and Corinth, till their
garrisons were finally expelled by the Romans in the name of
Hellenic liberty.</p>

<p>The new movement of commerce initiated by the conquest
of Alexander continued under his successors, though the break-up
of the Macedonian Empire in Asia in the 3rd century and the
distractions of the Seleucid court must have withheld many
<span class="sidenote">3. Commerce.</span>
advantages from the Greek merchants which a strong central
government might have afforded them. It was along
the great trade-routes between India and the West
that the main stream of riches flowed then as in later centuries.
One of these routes was by sea to south-west Arabia (Yemen), and
thence up the Red Sea to Alexandria. This was the route controlled
and developed by the Ptolemaïc kings. Between Yemen
and India the traffic till Roman times was mainly in the hands
of Arabians or Indians; between Alexandria and Yemen it was
carried by Greeks (Strabo ii. 118). The west coast of the Red
Sea was dotted with commercial stations of royal foundation
from Arsinoë north of Suez to Arsinoë in the south near the
straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. From Berenice on the Red Sea a
land-route struck across to the Nile at Coptos; this route the
kings furnished with watering stations. That there might also
be a waterway between Alexandria and the Red Sea, they cut
a canal between the Delta and the northern Arsinoë. It was
Alexandria into which this stream of traffic poured and made
it the commercial metropolis of the world. We hear of direct
diplomatic intercourse between the courts of Alexandria and
Pataliputra, <i>i.e.</i> Patna (Plin. vi. § 58). An alternative route
went from the Indian ports to the Persian Gulf, and thence found
the Mediterranean by caravan across Arabia from the country
of Gerrha to Gaza; and to control it was no doubt a motive in
the long struggle of the Ptolemaic and Seleucid houses for
Palestine, as well as in the attempt of Antiochus III. to subjugate
the Gerrhaeans. Or from the Persian Gulf wares might be taken
up the Euphrates and carried across to Antioch; this route lay
altogether in the Seleucid sphere. With Iran Antioch was
connected most directly by the road which crossed the Euphrates
at the Zeugma and went through Edessa and Antioch-Nisibis
to the Tigris. The trade from India which went down the Oxus
and then to the Caspian does not seem to have been considerable
(Tarn, <i>Journ. of Hell. Stud.</i> xxi. 10 seq.). From Antioch to
the Aegean the land high-road went across Asia Minor by the
Cilician Gates and the Phrygian Apamea.</p>

<p>Of the financial organization of the Macedonian kingdoms
we know practically nothing, except in the case of Egypt. Here
the papyri and ostraca have put a large material
at our disposal, but the circumstances in Egypt<a name="fa3t" id="fa3t" href="#ft3t"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
<span class="sidenote">4. Finance.</span>
were too peculiar for us to generalize upon these data as to the
Seleucid and Antigonid realms. That the Seleucid kings drew
in a principal part of their revenues from tribute levied upon the
various native races, distributed in their village communities
as tillers of the soil goes without saying.<a name="fa4t" id="fa4t" href="#ft4t"><span class="sp">4</span></a> In districts left in the
hands of native chiefs these chiefs would themselves exploit
their villages and pay the Seleucid court and tribute. To exact
tribute from Greek cities was invidious, but both Antigonid and
Seleucid kings often did so (Antigonid, Diog. Laërt. II., 140;
Plut. <i>Dem.</i> 27; Seleucid, Michel, No. 37; Polyb. xxi. 43, 2).
Sometimes, no doubt, this tribute was demanded under a fairer
name, as the contribution of any ally (<span class="grk" title="syntaxis">&#963;&#973;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#958;&#953;&#962;</span>, not <span class="grk" title="phoros">&#966;&#972;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>), like
the <span class="grk" title="Galatika">&#915;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#940;</span> levied by Antiochus I. (Michel, No. 37; cf. Polyb.
xxii. 27, 2). The royal domains, again, and royal monopolies,
such as salt-mines, were a source of revenue.<a name="fa5t" id="fa5t" href="#ft5t"><span class="sp">5</span></a> As to indirect
taxes, like customs and harbour dues, while their existence is
a matter of course (cf. Polyb. v. 89, 8), their scale, nature and
amount is quite unknown to us. Whatever the financial system
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>
of the Antigonid and Seleucid kingdoms may have been, it is clear
that they were far from enjoying the affluence of the Ptolemaic.
During the first Seleucid reigns indeed the revenues of Asia may
have filled its treasuries (see Just. xvii. 2, 13), but Antiochus III.
already at his accession found them depleted (Polyb. v. 50, 1),
and from his reign financial embarrassment, coupled with
extravagant expenditure, was here the usual condition of things.
Perseus, the last of the Antigonid house, amassed a substantial
treasure for the expenses of the supreme struggle with Rome
(Polyb. xviii. 35, 4; Liv. xlv, 40), but it was by means of almost
miserly economies.</p>

<p>Special officials were naturally attached to the service of the
finances. Over the whole department in the Seleucid realm
there presided a single chief (<span class="grk" title="ho epi tôn prosodôn">&#8001; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#948;&#969;&#957;</span>, App. <i>Syr</i>. 45).
How far the financial administration was removed from the
competence of the provincial governors, as it seems to have been
in Alexander&rsquo;s system, we cannot say. Seleucus at any rate, as
satrap of Babylonia, controlled the finances of the province (Diod.
xix. 55, 3), and so, in the Ptolemaic system, did the governor of
Cyprus (Polyb. xxvii. 13). The fact that provincial officials
<span class="grk" title="epi tôn prosodôn">&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#960;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#948;&#969;&#957;</span> (in Eriza, <i>Bull. corr. hell.</i> xv. 556) are found does
not prove anything, since it leaves open the question of their
being subordinate to the governor.</p>

<p>With the exception of Ptolemaic Egypt, the Macedonian
kingdoms followed in their coinage that of Alexander. Money
was for a long while largely struck with Alexander&rsquo;s
own image and superscription; the gold and silver
<span class="sidenote">5. Coinage.</span>
coined in the names of Antigonid and Seleucid kings and
by the minor principalities of Asia, kept to the Attic standard
which Alexander had established. Only in Egypt Ptolemy I.
adopted, at first the Rhodian, and afterwards the Phoenician,
standard, and on this latter standard the Ptolemaic money was
struck during the subsequent centuries. Money was also struck
in their own name by the cities in the several dynasties&rsquo; spheres
of power, but in most cases only bronze or small silver for local
use. Corinth, however, was allowed to go on striking staters
under Antigonus Gonatas; Ephesus, Cos and the greater cities
of Phoenicia retained their right of coinage under Seleucid or
Ptolemaic supremacy.</p>

<p>In language and manners the courts of Alexander&rsquo;s successors
were Greek. Even the Macedonian dialect, which it was considered
proper for the kings to use on occasion, was often forgotten
(Plut. <i>Ant.</i> 27). The Oriental features which
<span class="sidenote">6. The Court.</span>
Alexander had introduced were not copied. There was
no <i>proskynesis</i> (or certainly not in the case of Greeks
and Macedonians), and the king did not wear an Oriental dress.
The symbol of royalty, it is true, the <i>diadem</i>, was suggested by the
head-band of the old Persian kings (Just. xii. 3, 8); but, whereas,
that had been an imposing erection, the Hellenistic diadem was a
simple riband. The king&rsquo;s state dress was the same in principle
as that worn by the Macedonian or Thessalian horsemen, as the
uniform of his own cavalry officers. Its features were the broad-brimmed
hat (<i>kausia</i>), the cloak (<i>chlamys</i>) and the high-laced
boots (<i>krep&#299;des</i>) (Plut. <i>Ant.</i> 54; Frontinus, iii. 2, 11). These, in
the case of the king, would be of richer material, colour and
adornment. The diadem could be worn round the kausia; the
chlamys offered scope for gorgeous embroidery; and the boots
might be crimson felt (see the description of Demetrius&rsquo; chlamys
and boots, Plut. <i>Dem</i>. 41). There were other traces in the
Hellenistic courts of the old Macedonian tradition besides in
dress. One was the honour given to prowess in the chase (Polyb.
xxii. 3, 8; Diod. xxxiv. 34). Another was the fashion for the
king to hold wassail with his courtiers, in which he unbent to an
extent scandalous to the Greeks, dancing or indulging in routs
and practical jokes.<a name="fa6t" id="fa6t" href="#ft6t"><span class="sp">6</span></a></p>

<p>The prominent part taken by the women of the royal house
was a Macedonian characteristic. The history of these kingdoms
furnishes a long list of queens and princesses who were ambitious
and masterful politicians, of which the great Cleopatra is the
last and the most famous. The kings after Alexander, with
the exception of Demetrius Poliorcetes and Pyrrhus, are not
found to have more than one legitimate wife at a time, although
they show unstinted freedom in divorce and the number of
their mistresses. The custom of marriages between brothers
and sisters, agreeable to old Persian as to old Egyptian ethics,
was instituted in Egypt by the second Ptolemy when he married
his full sister Arsinoë Philadelphus. It was henceforth common,
though not invariable, among the Ptolemies. At the Seleucid
court there seems to be an instance of it in 195, when the heir-apparent,
Antiochus, married his sister Laodice. The style of
&ldquo;sister&rdquo; was given in both courts to the queen, even when she
was not the king&rsquo;s sister in reality (Strack, <i>Dynastie</i>, Nos. 38,
40, 43; <i>Archiv. f. Papyr</i>, i. 205). The &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; of the
king are often mentioned. It is usual for him to confer with a
council (<span class="grk" title="synedrion">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#948;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>) of his &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; before important decisions,
administrative, military or judicial (<i>e.g.</i> Polyb. v. 16, 5; 22, 8).
They form a definite body about the king&rsquo;s person (<span class="grk" title="philôn
syntagma">&#966;&#943;&#955;&#969;&#957; &#963;&#973;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#945;</span>, Polyb. xxxi. 3, 7); cf. <span class="grk" title="hoi philoi">&#959;&#7985; &#966;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span> in contrast with
<span class="grk" title="hai dynameis">&#945;&#7985; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>, id. v. 50, 9), admission into which depends upon
his favour alone, and is accorded, not only to his subjects, but
to aliens, such as the Greek refugee politicians (<i>e.g.</i> Hegesianax,
Athen. iv. 155b; Hannibal and the Aetolian Thoas take part in
the councils of Antiochus III. A similar body, with a title
corresponding to <span class="grk" title="philoi">&#966;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span>, is found in ancient Egypt (Erman,
<i>Ancient Egypt</i>, Eng. trans., p. 72) and in Persia (Spiegel. <i>Eran.
Alt.</i> iii. 626); but some such support is so obviously required
by the necessities of a despot&rsquo;s position that we need not
suppose it derived from any particular precedent. The Friends
(at any rate under the later Seleucid and Ptolemaïc reigns) were
distinguished by a special dress and badge of gold analogous
to the stars and crosses of modern orders. The dress was of
crimson (<span class="grk" title="porphyra">&#960;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#973;&#961;&#945;</span>); this and the badges were the king&rsquo;s gift,
and except by royal grant neither crimson nor gold might,
apparently, be worn at court (1 Macc. 10, 20; 62; 89; 11, 58;
Athen. v. 211b). The order of Friends was organized in a
hierarchy of ranks, which were multiplied as time went on.
In Egypt we find them classified as <span class="grk" title="syngeneis, homotimoi tois
syngenesin, archisômatophylakes, prôtoi philoi, philoi">&#963;&#965;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#962;, &#8001;&#956;&#972;&#964;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#953; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#963;&#965;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#941;&#963;&#953;&#957;, &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#953;&#963;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#966;&#973;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#962;, &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#953; &#966;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#953;, &#966;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span> (in the narrower
sense), <span class="grk" title="diadochoi">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#948;&#959;&#967;&#959;&#953;</span>. For the Seleucid kingdom <span class="grk" title="syngeneis, prôtoi
philoi">&#963;&#965;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#962;, &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#953; &#966;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span> and <span class="grk" title="philoi">&#966;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span> are mentioned. These classes do not appear in
Egypt before the 2nd century; Strack conjectures that they
were created in imitation of the Seleucid court. We have no
direct evidence as to the institutions of the Seleucid court in
the 3rd century. Certain <span class="grk" title="sômatophylakes">&#963;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#966;&#973;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#962;</span> of Antiochus I. are
mentioned, but we do not know whether the name was not
then used in its natural sense (Strack, <i>Rhein. Mus.</i> LV., 1900,
p. 161 seq.; Wilamowitz, <i>Archiv f. Pap.</i> I., p. 225; Beloch, <i>Gr.
Gesch.</i> iii (i), p. 391). As to Macedonia, whatever may have
been the constitution of the court, it is implied that it offered
in its externals a sober plainness in comparison with the vain
display and ceremonious frivolities of Antioch and Alexandria
(Polyb. xvi, 22, 5; Plut. <i>Cleom.</i> 31; <i>Arat</i>, 15). The position
of a Friend did not carry with it necessarily any functions;
it was in itself purely honorary. The ministers and high
officials were, on the other hand, regularly invested with one
or other of the ranks specified. The chief of these ministers
is denoted <span class="grk" title="ho epi tôn pragmatôn">&#8001; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;</span>, and he corresponds to the
<i>vizier</i> of the later East. All departments of government are
under his supervision, and he regularly holds the highest rank
of a kinsman. When the king is a minor, he acts as guardian
or regent (<span class="grk" title="epitropos">&#7952;&#960;&#943;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span>). Over different departments of state
we find a state secretary (<span class="grk" title="epistolographos">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#959;&#962;</span> or <span class="grk" title="hypomnêmatographos">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#957;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#959;&#962;</span>:
Seleucid, Polyb. xxxi, 3, 16; Ptolemaic, Strack, <i>Inschriften</i> 103)
and a minister of finance (<span class="grk" title="ho epi tôn prosodôn">&#8001; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#948;&#969;&#957;</span> in the Seleucid
kingdom; App. <i>Syr.</i> 45; <span class="grk" title="dioikêtês">&#948;&#953;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#942;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span> in Egypt, Lumbroso, <i>Econ.
Pol.</i> p. 339). Under each of these great heads of departments
was a host of lower officials, those, for instance, who held to the
province a relation analogous to that of the head of the department
of the realm. Such a provincial authority is described as
<span class="grk" title="epi tôn prosodôn">&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#948;&#969;&#957;</span> in the inscription of Eriza (<i>Bull. corr. hell.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>228</span>
xv. 556). Beside the officials concerned with the work of
government we have those of the royal household: (1) the chief-physician,
<span class="grk" title="archiatros">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#953;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#972;&#962;</span> (for the Seleucid see App. <i>Syr.</i> 59; Polyb. v.
56, 1; Michel, No. 1158; for the Pontic, <i>Bull. corr. hell.</i> vii.
354 seq.); (2) the chief-huntsman, <span class="grk" title="archikunêgos">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#965;&#957;&#951;&#947;&#972;&#962;</span> (Dittenb. <i>Orient.
Graec.</i> 99); (3) the maître-d&rsquo;hôtel <span class="grk" title="archedeatros">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#948;&#941;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span> (Dittenb. <i>Orient.
Graec.</i> 169) (4) the lord of the queen&rsquo;s bedchamber, <span class="grk" title="ho epi tou
koitônos tês Basilissês">&#8001; &#949;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#964;&#8182;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#962; &#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#963;&#963;&#951;&#962;</span> (Dittenb. <i>Orient. Graec.</i> 256). As in
the older Oriental courts, the high positions were often filled
by eunuchs (<i>e.g.</i> Craterus, in last mentioned inscription).</p>

<p>It was customary, as in Persia and in old Macedonia, for
the great men of the realm to send their children to court to
be brought up with the children of the royal house. Those who
had been so brought up with the king were styled his <span class="grk" title="syntrophoi">&#963;&#973;&#957;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#953;</span>
(for the Seleucid, Polyb. v. 82, 8 and xxxi. 21, 2; <i>Bull. corr. hell.</i>
i. 285; 2 Macc. ix. 29; for the Ptolemaic <span class="grk" title="syntrophoi paidiskai">&#963;&#973;&#957;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#953; &#960;&#945;&#943;&#948;&#953;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#953;</span>
of the queen, Polyb. xv. 33, 11; for the Pontic, <i>Bull. corr. hell.</i>
vii. 355; for the Pergamene. Polyb. xxxii. 27, 10, &amp;c.; for
the Herodian, Acts 13). It is perfectly gratuitous to suppose
with Deissmann that &ldquo;the fundamental meaning had given
place to the general meaning of intimate friend.&rdquo; With this
custom we may perhaps bring into connexion the office of
<span class="grk" title="tropheus">&#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#949;&#973;&#962;</span> (Polyb. xxxi. 20, 3; Michel, No. 1158). As under
Alexander, so under his successors, we find a corps of <span class="grk" title="Basilikoi
paîdes">&#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#943; &#960;&#945;&#8150;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span>. They appear as a corps, 600 strong, in a triumphal
procession at Antioch (Polyb. xxxi. 3, 17; cf. v. 82, 13; Antigonid,
Livy, xlv. 6; cf. Curtius, viii. 6, 6).</p>

<p>All the Hellenistic courts felt it a great part of prestige to be
filled with the light of Hellenic culture. A distinguished philosopher
or man of letters would find them bidding
for his presence, and most of the great names are
<span class="sidenote">7. Hellenic Culture.</span>
associated with one or other of the contemporary
kings. Antigonus Gonatas, bluff soldier-spirit that he was, heard
the Stoic philosophers gladly, and, though he failed to induce
Zeno to come to Macedonia, persuaded Zeno&rsquo;s disciple, Persaeus
of Citium, to enter his service. Nor was it philosophers only
who made his court illustrious, but poets like Aratus. The
Ptolemaic court, with the museum attached to it, is so prominent
in the literary and scientific history of the age that it is
unnecessary to give a list of the philosophers, the men of letters
and science, who at one time or other ate at King Ptolemy&rsquo;s
table. One may notice that the first Ptolemy himself made a
contribution of some value to historical literature in his account
of Alexander&rsquo;s campaigns; the fourth Ptolemy not only instituted
a cult of Homer but himself published tragedies; and
even Ptolemy Euergetes II. issued a book of memoirs. The
Pergamene court was in no degree behind the Ptolemaic in its
literary and artistic zeal. The notable school of sculpture
connected with it is treated elsewhere (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Art</a></span>); to its
literary school we probably owe in great part the preservation
of the masterpieces of Attic prose (Susemihl I., p. 4), and two
of its kings (Eumenes I. and Attalus III.) were themselves
authors. The Seleucid court did not rival either of the last
named in brilliance of culture; and yet some names of distinction
were associated with it. Under Antiochus I. Aratus carried
out a recension of the <i>Odyssey</i>, and Berossus composed a Babylonian
history in Greek; under Antiochus III. Euphorion was
made keeper of the library at Antioch. Antiochus IV., of course,
the enthusiastic Hellenist, filled Antioch with Greek artists
and gave a royal welcome to Athenian philosophers. Even
in the degenerate days of the dynasty, Antiochus Grypus, who
had been brought up at Athens, aspired to shine as a poet. The
values recognized in the great Hellenistic courts and the Greek
world generally imposed their authority upon the dynasties
of barbarian origin. The Cappadocian court admitted the full
stream of Hellenistic culture under Ariarathes V. (Diod. xxxi.
19, 8). One of the kings called Nicomedes in Bithynia offered
immense sums to acquire the Aphrodite of Praxiteles from the
Cnidians (Plin. <i>N.H.</i> xxxvi. 21), and to a king Nicomedes the
geographical poem of the Pseudo-Scymnus is dedicated. Even
Iranian kings in the last century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> found pleasure in composing,
or listening to, Greek tragedies, and Herod the Great
kept Greek men of letters beside him and had spasmodic
ambitions to make his mark as an orator or author (Nicol.
Dam. frag. 4; <i>F.H.G.</i> III. p. 350).</p>

<p>The offering of divine honours to the king, which we saw
begin under Alexander, became stereotyped in the institutions
of the succeeding Hellenistic kingdoms. Alexander
himself was after his death the object of various
<span class="sidenote">8. Divine Honours.</span>
local cults, like that which centred in the shrine near
Erythrae (Strabo, xiv. 644). His successors in the first years after
his death recognized him officially as a divinity, except Antipater
(Suïdas, <i>s.v.</i> <span class="grk" title="Antipatros">&#913;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>), and coins began to be issued with his
image. At Alexandria the state cult of him seems to have been
instituted by the second Ptolemy, when his body was laid in the
<i>Sema</i> (Otto, <i>Priester u. Tempel</i>, i. 139 seq.). The successors
themselves received divine honours. Such worship might be the
spontaneous homage of a particular Greek community, like that
offered to Antigonus by Scepsis in 311 (<i>Journ. of Hell. Stud.</i>
xix. 335 seq.), the Antigonus and Demetrius by Athens in 307,
to Ptolemy I. by the Rhodians in 304, or by Cassandrea to
Cassander, as the city&rsquo;s founder (Ditt. 2nd ed. 178); or it
might be organized and maintained by royal authority. The
first proved instance of a cult of the latter kind is that instituted
at Alexandria by the second Ptolemy for his father soon after
the latter&rsquo;s death in 283/2, in which, some time after, 279/8,
he associated his mother Berenice also, the two being worshipped
together as <span class="grk" title="theoi sôtêres">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8054; &#963;&#969;&#964;&#8134;&#961;&#949;&#962;</span> (Theoc. xvii. 121 seq.). Antiochus I.
followed the Ptolemaic precedent by instituting at Seleucia-in-Pieria
a cult for his father as Seleucus Zeus Nicator. So
far we can point to no instance of a cult of the living sovereign
(though the cities might institute such locally) being established
by the court for the realm. This step was taken in
Egypt after the death of Arsinoë Philadelphus (271) when
she and her still-living brother-husband, Ptolemy II., began
to be worshipped together as <span class="grk" title="theoi adelphoi">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8054; &#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#943;</span>. After this the
cult of the reigning king and queen was regularly maintained
in Greek Egypt, side by side with that of the dead Ptolemies.
Under Antiochus II. (261-246) a document shows us a cult
of the reigning king in full working for the Seleucid realm,
with a high priest in each province, appointed by the king
himself; the document declares that the Queen Laodice is
now to be associated with the king. The official surname of
Antiochus II., Theos, suggests that he himself had here been
the innovator. Thenceforward, in the Hellenistic kingdoms
of the East the worship of the living sovereign became the
rule, although it appears to have been regarded as given in
anticipation of an apotheosis which did not become actual
till death. In the Pergamene kingdom at any rate, though
the living king was worshipped with sacrifice, the title <span class="grk" title="theos">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</span>
was only given to those who were dead (Cardinali, <i>Regno di
Pergamo</i>, p. 153). The Antigonid dynasty, simpler and saner
in its manners, had no official cult of this sort. The divine
honours offered on occasion by the Greek cities were the
independent acts of the cities.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>See Plut. <i>Arat.</i> 45; <i>Cleom.</i> 16; Kornemann, &ldquo;Zur Gesch. d. antiken
Herrscherkulte&rdquo; in <i>Beiträge z. alt. Gesch.</i> i. 51 sqq.; Otto, <i>Priester u.
Tempel</i>, pp. 138 seq.</p>

<p>There does not seem any clear proof that the surnames which
the Hellenistic kings in Asia and Egypt bore were necessarily connected
with the cult, even if they were used to describe
the various kings in religious ceremonies. Some had
<span class="sidenote">9. Surnames.</span>
doubtless a religious colour, <i>Theos, Epiphanes, Soter</i>; others a
dynastic, <i>Phitopator, Philometor, Philadelphus</i>. Under what circumstances,
and by whose selection, the surname was attached to a king,
is obscure. It is noteworthy that while modern books commonly
speak of the surnames as <i>assumed</i>, the explanations given by our
ancient authorities almost invariably suppose them to be given as
marks of homage or gratitude (<i>English Historical Review</i>, xvi. 629
(1901). The official surnames must not, of course, be confused with
the popular nicknames which were naturally not recognized by the
court, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Ceraunus</i> (&ldquo;Thunder&rdquo;), <i>Hierax</i> (&ldquo;Hawk&rdquo;), <i>Physcon</i>
(&ldquo;Pot-belly&rdquo;), <i>Lathyrus</i> (&ldquo;Chick-pea&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The armies of Alexander&rsquo;s successors were still in the main principles
of their organization similar to the army with which Alexander
had conquered Asia. During the years immediately
after Alexander the very Macedonians who had fought
<span class="sidenote">10. Armies.</span>
under Alexander were ranged against each other under the banners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span>
of the several chiefs. The most noted corps of veterans, Argyraspides
(<i>i.e.</i> the royal Hypaspistae) played a great part in the first
wars of the successors, and covered themselves with infamy by their
betrayal of Eumenes. As the soldiers of Alexander died off, fresh
levies of home-born Macedonians could be raised only by the chief
who held the motherland. The other chiefs had to supply themselves
with Macedonians from the numerous colonies planted before the
break-up of the empire in Asia or Egypt, and from such Macedonians
they continued for the next two centuries to form their phalanx.
The breed&mdash;at least if the statement which Livy puts into the mouth
of a Roman general can be relied on&mdash;degenerated greatly under
Asiatic and Egyptian skies (Liv. xxxviii. 17, 10); but still old names
like that of <i>pezetaeri</i> attached to the phalangites (Plut. <i>Tib.</i> 17),
and they still wielded the national <i>sarissa</i>. The latter weapon in
the interval between Alexander and the time of Polybius had been
increased to a length of 21 ft. (Polyb. xviii. 12), a proportion inconsistent
with any degree of mobility; once more indeed the phalanx
of the 2nd century seems to have become a body effective by
sheer weight only and disordered by unevenness of ground. The
Antigonid kings were never able from Macedonian levies to put in
the field a phalanx of more than 20,000 at the utmost (Liv. xlii. 51);
Antigonus Doson takes with him to Greece (in 222) one of 10,000 only.
The phalanx of Antiochus III. at Raphia numbered 20,000, and
Ptolemy Philopator was able at the same time to form one of 25,000
men (Polyb. v. 4). As these phalangites are distinguished both from
the Greek mercenaries and the native Egyptian levies, it looks
(although such a fact would be staggering) as if more Macedonians
could be raised for military service in Egypt than in Macedonia
itself (but see Beloch, p. 353). The royal foot-guards are still described
in Macedonia in 171 as the <i>agema</i> (Polyb. v. 25, 1; 27, 3; Liv. xlii.
51), when they number 2000; at the Ptolemaic court in 217 the <i>agema</i>
had numbered 3000 (Polyb. v. 65, 2); and a similar corps of <i>hypaspistae</i>
is indicated in the Seleucid army (Polyb. vii. 16, 2; xvi. 18, 7).
So too the old name of &ldquo;Companions&rdquo; was kept up in the Seleucid
kingdom for the Macedonian cavalry (see Polyb. v. 53, 4, &amp;c.), and
divisions of rank in it are still indicated by the terms <i>agema</i> and
royal squadron (<span class="grk" title="basilikê hilê">&#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#8052; &#7989;&#955;&#951;</span>, see Bevan, <i>House of Seleucus</i>, ii. 288).
The Antigonid and Seleucid courts had much valuable material at
hand for their armies in the barbarian races under their sway. The
Balkan hill-peoples of Illyrian or Thracian stock, the hill-peoples of
Asia Minor and Iran, the chivalry of Media and Bactria, the mounted
bowmen of the Caspian steppes, the camel-riders of the Arabian
desert, could all be turned to account. Iranian troops seem to
have been employed on a large scale by the earlier Seleucids. At
Raphia, Antiochus III. had 10,000 men drawn from the provinces,
armed and drilled as Macedonians, and another corps of Iranians numbering
5000 under a native commander (Polyb. v. 79). The experiment
of arming the native Egyptians on a large scale does not seem
to have been made before the campaign of 217, when Ptolemy IV.
formed corps of the Macedonian pattern from Egyptians and
Libyans (cf. Polyb. v. 107, 2; Ptolemy I. had employed Egyptians
in the army, though chiefly as carriers, Diod. xix. 80, 4). From
this time native rebellions in Egypt are recurrent. To the troops
drawn from their own dominions the mercenaries which the kings
procured from abroad were an important supplement. These were
mainly the bands of Greek <i>condottieri</i>, and even for their home-born
troops Greek officers of renown were often engaged. The other
class of mercenaries were Gauls, and from the time of the Gallic invasion
of Asia Minor in 279 Gauls or Galatians were a regular constituent
in all armies. They were a weapon apt to be dangerous
to the employer, but the terror they inspired was such that every
potentate sought to get hold of them. The elephants which Alexander
brought back from India were used in the armies of his successors,
and in 302 Seleucus procured a new supply. Thenceforward elephants,
either brought fresh from India or bred in the royal stables
at Apamea, regularly figured in the Seleucid armies. The Ptolemies
supplied themselves with this arm from the southern coasts of the
Red Sea, where they established stations for the capture and shipping
of elephants, but the African variety was held inferior to the Indian.
Scythed chariots such as had figured in the old Persian armies were
still used by the Greek masters of Asia (Seleucus I., Diod. xx. 113, 4;
Molon, Polyb. v. 53, 10; Antiochus III., Liv. xxxvii. 41), at any rate
till the battle of Magnesia. The Hellenistic armies were distinguished
by their external magnificence. They made a greater display of
brilliant metal and gorgeous colour than the Roman armies, for
instance. The description given by Justin of the army which Antiochus
Sidetes took to the East in 130 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, boot-nails and bridles of
gold, gives an idea of their standard of splendour (Just. xxxviii. 10, 1;
cf. Polyb. xxxi. 3; Plut. <i>Eum.</i> 14; id. <i>Aemil.</i> 18; id. <i>Sulla</i>, 16).</p>

<p>During the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Egypt was the greatest sea power of
the eastern Mediterranean, and maintained a large fleet (the figures
in App. <i>Prooem</i>, 10 are not trustworthy, see Beloch III. [i.], 364).
Its control of the Aegean was, however, contested not without success
by the Antigonids, who won the two great sea-fights of Cos (<i>c.</i> 256)
and Andros (227), and wrested the overlordship of the Cyclades from
the Ptolemies. Of the numbers and constitution of the Antigonid
fleet we know nothing.<a name="fa7t" id="fa7t" href="#ft7t"><span class="sp">7</span></a> At the Seleucid court in 222 the admiral
(<span class="grk" title="nauarchos">&#957;&#945;&#973;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#962;</span>) appears as a person of high consideration (Polyb. v. 43, 1);
in his war with Rome Antiochus III. had 107 decked battleships on
the sea at one time. By the Peace of Apamea (188) the Seleucid
navy was abolished; Antiochus undertook to keep no more than
10 ships of war.</p>

<p>To their native subjects the Seleucid and Ptolemaic kings
were always foreigners. It was considered wonderful in the last
Cleopatra that she learnt to speak Egyptian (Plut.
<i>Anton.</i> 27). Natives were employed, as we have
<span class="sidenote">11. Treatment of Subject Peoples.</span>
seen, in the army, and Iranians are found under the
Seleucids holding high commands, <i>e.g.</i> Aspasianus the
Mede (Polyb. v. 79, 7), Aribazus, governor of Cilicia (Flinders
Petrie, <i>Papyri</i>, II., No. 45), Aribazus, governor of Sardis
(Polyb. vii. 17, 9), and Omanes (Michel, No. 19, l. 104). Native
cults the Hellenistic kings thought it good policy to patronize.
Antiochus I. began rebuilding the temple of Nebo at Borsippa
(<i>Keilinschr. Bibl.</i> iii. 2, 136 seq.) Antiochus III. bestowed favours
on the Temple at Jerusalem. Even if the documents in Joseph,
<i>Arch.</i> xii. §§ 138 seq. are spurious, their general view of the relation
of Antiochus III. and Jerusalem is probably true. Even
small local worships, like that of the village of Baetocaece,
might secure royal patronage (<i>C.I.G.</i> No. 4474). Of course,
financial straits might drive the kings to lay hands on
temple-treasures, as Antiochus III. and Antiochus IV. did, but
that was a measure of emergency.</p>

<p>The Macedonian kingdoms, strained by continual wars,
increasingly divided against themselves, falling often under
the sway of prodigals and debauchees, were far
from realizing the Hellenic idea of sound government
<span class="sidenote">12. Significance of Macedonian Rule.</span>
as against the crude barbaric despotisms of
the older East. Yet, in spite of all corruption, ideas
of the intelligent development of the subject lands, visions
of the Hellenic king, as the Greek thinkers had come to picture
him, haunted the Macedonian rulers, and perhaps fitfully,
in the intervals of war or carousal, prompted some degree of
action. Treatises &ldquo;Concerning Kingship&rdquo; were produced as
a regular thing by philosophers, and kings who claimed the
fine flower of Hellenism, could not but peruse them. Strabo
regards the loss of the eastern provinces to the Parthians as
their passage under a government of lower type, beyond the
sphere of Hellenic <span class="grk" title="epimegeia">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span> (Strabo xi. 509). In the organization
of the administrative machinery of these kingdoms, the
higher power of the Hellene to adapt and combine had been
operative; they were organisms of a richer, more complex
type than the East had hitherto known. It was thus that
when Rome became a world-empire, it found to some extent
the forms of government ready made, and took over from
the Hellenistic monarchies a tradition which it handed on to
the later world.</p>

Eusebius of Nicomedia, was elected by the Arian bishops in 341,
while the orthodox party elected Paul, whom Eusebius had
superseded. The partisans of the two rivals involved the city
in a tumultuous broil, and were not quelled until the emperor
Constantius II. banished Paul. Macedonius was recognized
as patriarch in 342. Compelled by the intervention of Constans
in 348 to resign the patriarchate in favour of his former opponent,
he was reinstalled in 350. He then took vengeance on
his opponents by a general persecution of the adherents of the

Nicene Creed. In 359, on the division of the Arian party into
Acacians (or pure Arians) and semi-Arians or Homoiousians,
Macedonius adhered to the latter, and in consequence was
expelled from his see by the council of Constantinople in 360.
He now became avowed leader of the sect of Pneumatomachi,
Macedonians or Marathonians, whose distinctive tenet was
that the Holy Spirit is but a being similar to the angels, subordinate
to and in the service of the Father and the Son, the
relation between whom did not admit of a third. He did not
long survive his deposition.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACEIÓ<a name="ar170" id="ar170"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Maçayó</span>, a city and port of Brazil and capital of
the state of Alagôas, about 125 m. S.S.W. of Pernambuco, in
lat. 9° 39&prime; 35&Prime; S., long. 35° 44&prime; 36&Prime; W. Pop. including a large
rural district and several villages (1890), 31,498; (1908, estimate),
33,000. The city stands at the foot of low bluffs, about a mile
from the shore line. The water-side village of Jaraguá, the
port of Maceió, is practically a suburb of the city. South
of the port is the shallow entrance to the Lagôa do Norte,
of Lagôa Mundahú, a salt-water lake extending inland for
some miles. Maceió is attractively situated in the midst of large
plantations of coco-nut and <i>dendé</i> palms, though the broad
sandy beach in front and the open sun-burned plain behind give
a barren character to its surroundings. The heat is moderated
by the S.E. trade winds, and the city is considered healthful.
The public buildings are mostly constructed of broken stone
and mortar, plastered outside and covered with red tiles,
but the common dwellings are generally constructed of <i>tapia</i>&mdash;rough
trellis-work walls filled in with mud. A light tramway
connects the city and port, and a railway&mdash;the Alagôas Central&mdash;connects
the two with various interior towns. The port is
formed by a stone reef running parallel with and a half-mile
from the shore line, within which vessels of light draft find
a safe anchorage, except from southerly gales. Ocean-going
steamers anchor outside the reef. The exports consist principally
of sugar, cotton, and rum (<i>aguardiente</i>). Maceió dates
from 1815 when a small settlement there was created a &ldquo;villa.&rdquo;
In 1839 it became the provincial capital and was made a city
by the provincial assembly.</p>

the province of Macerata and a bishop&rsquo;s see, 44 m. by rail S. of
Ancona. Pop. (1901), 6,176 (town), 22,473 (commune). Crowning
a hill 919 ft. above sea-level, with a picturesque mass of
buildings enclosed by walls and towers, Macerata looks out over
the Adriatic. The cathedral is modern, but some of the churches
and palaces are not without interest. Besides the university,
agricultural school and industrial institute, Macerata has a
communal library founded by Leo XII., containing a small but
choice collection of early pictures, and in the municipal buildings,
a collection of antiquities from Helvia Ricina. There is an enormous
amphitheatre or <i>sferisterio</i> for <i>pallone</i>, a ball game which is
very popular in the district. The industries comprise the making
of bricks, matches, terra-cotta and chemicals.</p>

<p>Macerata, as well as Recanati, was founded by the inhabitants
of Ricina after the destruction of their city by Alaric in 408.
During the Lombard period it was a flourishing town; but it was
raised from comparative insignificance by Nicholas IV. to be the
seat of the governors of the March. It was enclosed in the 13th
century by a new line of walls more than 2½ m. in circuit; and
in the troubles of the next two hundred years it had frequent
occasion to learn their value. For the most part it remained
faithful to the popes, and in return it was rewarded by a multitude
of privileges. Though in 1797 the inhabitants opened their
gates to the French, two years afterwards, when the country
people took refuge within the walls, the city was taken by storm
and delivered to pillage. The bishopric of Macerata dates from
the suppression of the see of Recanati (1320).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACFARREN, SIR GEORGE ALEXANDER<a name="ar174" id="ar174"></a></span> (1813-1887),
English composer, was born in London on the 2nd of March
1813, and entered the Royal Academy of Music in 1829. A
symphony by him was played at an Academy concert in 1830;
for the opening of the Queen&rsquo;s Theatre in Tottenham Street,
under the management of his father, in 1831, he wrote an overture.
His <i>Chevy Chase</i> overture, the orchestral work by which
he is perhaps best known, was written as early as 1836, and in a
single night. On leaving the Academy in 1836, Macfarren was
for about a year a music teacher in the Isle of Man, and wrote
two unsuccessful operas. In 1837 he was appointed a professor
at the Academy, and wrote his <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> overture. In
the following year he brought out <i>The Devil&rsquo;s Opera</i>, one of his
best works. In 1843 he became conductor at Covent Garden,
producing the <i>Antigone</i> with Mendelssohn&rsquo;s music; his opera on
<i>Don Quixote</i> was produced under Bunn at Drury Lane in 1846;
his subsequent operas include <i>Charles II.</i> (1849), <i>Robin Hood</i>
(1860), <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i> (1864), and <i>Helvellyn</i> (1864). A
gradual failure of his eyesight, which had been defective from
boyhood, resulted in total blindness in 1865, but he overcame
the difficulties by employing an amanuensis in composition, and
made hardly a break in the course of his work. He was made
principal of the Royal Academy of Music in succession to Sterndale
Bennett in February 1875, and in March of the same year
professor of music in Cambridge University. Shortly before
this he had begun a series of oratorios: <i>St John the Baptist</i>
(Bristol, 1873); <i>Resurrection</i> (Birmingham, 1876); <i>Joseph</i> (Leeds,
1877); and <i>King David</i> (Leeds, 1883). In spite of their solid
workmanship, and the skill with which the ideas are treated, it is
difficult to hear or read them through without smiling at some
of the touches of quite unconscious humour often resulting from
the way in which the Biblical narratives have been, as it were,
dramatized. He delivered many lectures of great and lasting
value, and his theoretical works, such as the <i>Rudiments of
Harmony</i>, and the treatise on counterpoint, will probably be
remembered longer than many of his compositions. He was
knighted in 1883, and died suddenly in London on the 31st of
October 1887.</p>

<p><span class="bold">McGEE, THOMAS D&rsquo;ARCY<a name="ar175" id="ar175"></a></span> (1825-1868), Irish-Canadian
politician and writer, second son of James McGee, a coast-guard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>231</span>
was born at Carlingford, Co. Louth, on the 13th of April 1825.
He early showed a remarkable aptitude for oratory. At the
age of thirteen he delivered a speech at Wexford, and when four
years later he emigrated to America he quickly gained a reputation
as a writer and public speaker in the city of Boston. He
thus attracted the attention of O&rsquo;Connell, and before he was
twenty years of age he returned to London to become parliamentary
correspondent of the <i>Freeman&rsquo;s Journal</i>, and shortly
afterwards London correspondent of the <i>Nation</i>, to which he
also contributed a number of poems. He married in 1847 Mary
Theresa Caffry, by whom he had two children. In 1846 he became
one of the moving spirits in the &ldquo;Young Ireland&rdquo; party,
and in promoting the objects of that organization he contributed
two volumes to the &ldquo;Library of Ireland.&rdquo; On the failure of the
movement in 1848 McGee escaped in the disguise of a priest to
the United States, where between 1848 and 1853 he established
two newspapers, the <i>New York Nation</i> and the <i>American Celt</i>.
His writings at first were exceedingly bitter and anti-English; but
as years passed he realized that a greater measure of political
freedom was possible under the British constitution than under
the American. He had now become well-known as an author,
and as a lecturer of unusual ability. In 1857 McGee, driven from
the United States by the scurrilous attacks of the extreme
Irish revolutionaries, took up his abode in Canada, and was
admitted to the bar of the province of Lower Canada in 1861. At
the general election in 1858 he was returned to parliament as the
member for Montreal, and for four years he was regarded as a
powerful factor in the house. On the formation of the Sandfield-Macdonald-Sicotte
administration in 1862 he accepted the
office of president of the council. When the cabinet was reconstructed
a year later the Irish were left without representation,
and McGee sought re-election as a member of the opposite party.
In 1864 he was appointed minister of agriculture in the administration
of Sir E. P. Taché, and he served the country in that
capacity until his death. He actively supported the policy of
federation and was elected a member of the first Dominion parliament
in 1867. On the 7th of April 1868, after having delivered
a notable speech in the house, he was shot by an assassin as he
was about to enter his house at Ottawa. His utterances against
the Fenian invasion are believed to have been the cause of the
crime for which P. J. Whelan was executed. McGee&rsquo;s loss was
keenly felt by all classes, and within a few weeks of his death
parliament granted an annuity to his widow and children.
McGee had great faith in the future of Canada as a part of the
empire. Speaking at St John, N.B., in 1863, he said: &ldquo;There
are before the public men of British America at this moment
but two courses: either to drift with the tide of democracy,
or to seize the golden moment and fix for ever the monarchical
character of our institutions. I invite every fellow colonist
who agrees with me to unite our efforts that we may give our
province the aspect of an empire, in order to exercise the influence
abroad and at home of a state, and to originate a history
which the world will not willingly let die.&rdquo; Sir Charles Gavan
Duffy considered that as a poet McGee was not inferior to Davis,
and that as an orator he possessed powers rarer than those of
T. F. Meagher.</p>

<p><span class="bold">McGIFFERT, ARTHUR CUSHMAN<a name="ar176" id="ar176"></a></span> (1861-&emsp;&emsp;), American
theologian, was born in Sauquoit, New York, on the 4th of March
1861, the son of a Presbyterian clergyman of Scotch descent.
He graduated at Western Reserve College in 1882 and at Union
theological seminary in 1885, studied in Germany (especially
under Harnack) in 1885-1887, and in Italy and France in 1888,
and in that year received the degree of doctor of philosophy at
Marburg. He was instructor (1888-1890) and professor (1890-1893)
of church history at Lane theological seminary, and in 1893
became Washburn professor of church history in Union theological
seminary, succeeding Dr Philip Schaff. His published work,
except occasional critical studies in philosophy, dealt with
church history and the history of dogma. His best known publication
is a <i>History of Christianity in the Apostolic Age</i> (1897).
This book, by its independent criticism and departures from
traditionalism, aroused the opposition of the General Assembly
of the Presbyterian Church; though the charges brought against
McGiffert were dismissed by the Presbytery of New York, to
which they had been referred, a trial for heresy seemed inevitable,
and McGiffert, in 1900, retired from the Presbyterian ministry
and entered the Congregational Church, although he retained
his position in Union theological seminary. Among his other
publications are: <i>A Dialogue between a Christian and a Jew</i>
(1888); a translation (with introduction and notes) of Eusebius&rsquo;s
<i>Church History</i> (1890); and <i>The Apostles&rsquo; Creed</i> (1902), in which
he attempted to prove that the old Roman creed was formulated
as a protest against the dualism of Marcion and his denial of the
reality of Jesus&rsquo;s life on earth.</p>

<p><span class="bold">McGILLIVRAY, ALEXANDER<a name="ar177" id="ar177"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1730-1793), American
Indian chief, was born near the site of the present Wetumpka, in
Alabama. His father was a Scotch merchant and his mother
the daughter of a French officer and an Indian &ldquo;princess.&rdquo;
Through his father&rsquo;s relatives in South Carolina, McGillivray
received a good education, but at the age of seventeen, after a
short experience as a merchant in Savannah and Pensacola, he
returned to the Muscogee Indians, who elected him chief. He
retained his connexion with business life as a member of the
British firm of Panton, Forbes &amp; Leslie of Pensacola. During
the War of Independence, as a colonel in the British army, he
incited his followers to attack the western frontiers of Georgia
and the Carolinas. Georgia confiscated some of his property,
and after the peace of 1783 McGillivray remained hostile.
Though still retaining his British commission, he accepted one
from Spain, and during the remainder of his life used his influence
to prevent American settlement in the south-west. So
important was he considered that in 1790 President Washington
sent an agent who induced him to visit New York. Here he was
persuaded to make peace in consideration of a brigadier-general&rsquo;s
commission and payment for the property confiscated by Georgia;
and with the warriors who accompanied him he signed a formal
treaty of peace and friendship on the 7th of August. He then
went back to the Indian country, and remained hostile to the
Americans until his death. He was one of the ablest Indian
leaders of America and at one time wielded great power&mdash;having
5000 to 10,000 armed followers. In order to serve Indian
interests he played off British, Spanish and American interests
against one another, but before he died he saw that he was fighting
in a losing cause, and, changing his policy, endeavoured to
provide for the training of the Muscogees in the white man&rsquo;s
civilization. McGillivray was polished in manners, of cultivated
intellect, was a shrewd merchant, and a successful speculator;
but he had many savage traits, being noted for his treachery,
craftiness and love of barbaric display.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACGILLIVRAY, WILLIAM<a name="ar178" id="ar178"></a></span> (1796-1852), Scottish naturalist,
was born at Aberdeen on the 25th of January 1796. At King&rsquo;s
College, Aberdeen, he graduated in 1815, and also studied medicine,
but did not complete the latter course. In 1823 he became
assistant to R. Jameson, professor of natural history in Edinburgh
University; and in 1831 he was appointed curator of the
museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh, a post
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span>
which he resigned in 1841 to become professor of natural history
and lecturer on botany in Marischal College, Aberdeen. He died
at Aberdeen on the 4th of September 1852. He possessed a wide
and comprehensive knowledge of natural science, gained no
less from personal observations in different parts of Scotland
than from a study of collections and books. His industry and
extensive knowledge are amply shown in his published works.
He assisted J. J. Audubon in his classical works on the <i>Birds of
America</i>, and edited W. Withering&rsquo;s <i>British Plants</i>. His larger
works include biographies of A. von Humboldt, and of zoologists
from Aristotle to Linnaeus, a <i>History of British Quadrupeds</i>, a
<i>History of the Molluscous Animals of Aberdeen, Banff and Kincardine</i>,
a <i>Manual of British Ornithology</i>, and a <i>History of British
Birds</i>, in 5 vols. (1837-1852). The last work holds a high rank
from the excellent descriptions of the structure, habits and haunts
of birds, and from the use in classification of characters afforded
by their anatomical structure. His <i>Natural History of Deeside</i>,
posthumously published by command of Queen Victoria, was
the result of a sojourn in the highlands of Aberdeenshire in
1850. He made large collections, alike for the instruction of his
students and to illustrate the zoology, botany and geology
of the parts of Scotland examined by him, especially around
Aberdeen, and a number of his original water-colour drawings
are preserved in the British Museum (Natural History).</p>

canoeist, traveller and philanthropist, son of General Sir Duncan
MacGregor, K.C.B., was born at Gravesend on the 24th of
January 1825. He combined a roving disposition with a natural
taste for mechanics and for literature. In 1839 he went to
Trinity College, Dublin, and in 1844 to Trinity, Cambridge,
where he was a wrangler. He was called to the bar in 1851, but
did not pursue his profession. He travelled a great deal in
Europe, Egypt, Palestine, Russia, Algeria and America, and
between 1853 and 1863 was largely occupied with researches
into the history and methods of marine propulsion. He was
the pioneer of British canoeing. In 1865 he started on a long
canoeing cruise in his &ldquo;Rob Roy&rdquo; canoe, and in this way
made a prolonged water tour through Europe, a record of
which he published in 1866 as <i>A Thousand Miles in the Rob Roy
Canoe</i>. This book made MacGregor and his canoe famous.
He made similar voyages in later years in Norway, Sweden
and Denmark, the North Sea and Palestine. Another voyage,
in the English Channel and on French waters, was made in a
yawl. He published accounts of all these journeys. He did
not, however, confine his energies to travelling. He was active
in charity and philanthropic work, being one of the founders of
the Shoe-black Brigade. In 1870 and again in 1873 he was
elected on the London school board. He died at Boscombe on
the 16th of July 1892.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACH, ERNST<a name="ar180" id="ar180"></a></span> (1838-&emsp;&emsp;), Austrian physicist and psychologist,
was born on the 18th of February 1838 at Turas in Moravia,
and studied at Vienna. He was professor of mathematics at
Gratz (1864-1867), of physics at Prague (1867-1895), and of
physics at Vienna (1895-1901). In 1879 and 1880 as <i>Rector
Magnificus</i> he fought against the introduction of Czech instead
of German in the Prague University. In 1901 he was made a
member of the Austrian house of peers. In philosophy he began
with a strong predilection for the physical side of psychology,
and at an early age he came to the conclusion that all existence
is sensation, and, after a lapse into noümenalism under the influence
of Fechner&rsquo;s <i>Psychophysics</i>, finally adopted a universal
physical phenomenalism. The Ego he considers not an entity
sharply distinguished from the Non-ego, but merely, as it were,
a medium of continuity of sensory impressions. His whole
theory appears to be vitiated by the confusion of physics and
psychology.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACHAERODUS,<a name="ar181" id="ar181"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Machairodus</span>, the typical genus of a
group of long-tusked extinct cats, commonly known as sabre-tooths.
Although best regarded as a sub-family (<i>Machaerodontinae</i>)
of the <i>Felidae</i>, they are sometimes referred to a separate
family under the name <i>Nimravidae</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carnivora</a></span>). The later
forms, as well as some of the earlier ones, are more specialized
as regards dentition than the modern <i>Felidae</i>, although in several
other respects they exhibit more primitive features. The general
type of dentition is feline, but in some instances more premolars
are retained, as well as a small tubercular molar behind the lower
carnassial. The characteristic feature is, however, the great
development of the upper canines, which in the more specialized
types reach far below the margin of the lower jaw, despite the
development of a flange-like expansion of the extremity of the
latter for their protection. In these extreme forms it is quite
evident that the jaws could not be used in the ordinary manner;
and it seems probable that in attacking prey the lower jaw was
dropped to a vertical position, and the huge upper tusks used as
stabbing instruments. The group is believed to be derived from
a creodont allied to the Eocene <i>Palaeonictis</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Creodonta</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Nimravus</i>, of the American Oligocene, with two premolars and
two molars in the lower jaw, and comparatively short upper
canines, seems to be the least specialized type; next to which
comes <i>Hoplophoneus</i>, another North American Oligocene genus,
in which the tubercular lower molar is lost, and the upper canine
is longer. It is noteworthy, however, that this genus retains
the third trochanter to the femur, which is lost in <i>Nimravus</i>.
<i>Machaerodus</i>, in the wider sense, includes the larger and more
typical forms. In the Pliocene of France and Italy it is represented
by <i>M. megantereon</i>, a species not larger than a leopard,
and allied forms occur in the Pliocene of Greece, Hungary,
Samos, Persia, India and China, as well as in the Middle Miocene
of France and Germany. Far larger is the Pleistocene
<i>M. cultridens</i> of the caverns of Europe, with serrated upper tusks
several inches in length. From Europe and Asia the sabre-toothed
tigers may be traced into North and thence into South
America, the home of <i>M. (Smilodon) neogaeus</i>, the largest of the
whole tribe, whose remains occur in the Brazilian caves and the
silt of the Argentine pampas. This animal was as large as a
tiger, with tusks projecting seven inches from the jaw and very
complex carnassials; the feet were very short, with only four toes
to the hind-pair, and the humerus has lost the foramen at the
lower end. Very noteworthy is the occurrence of an imperfectly
known specialized type&mdash;<i>Eusmilus</i>&mdash;in the Lower Oligocene
of Europe and perhaps also North America. Unlike all
other cats, it had only two pairs of lower incisors, and the large
cheek-teeth were reduced to the carnassial and one premolar in
advance of the same.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACHALE, JOHN<a name="ar182" id="ar182"></a></span> (1791-1881), Irish divine, was born on the
15th of March 1791 at Tuber-na-Fian, Mayo, and was educated
at Maynooth, where after graduating in 1814 he was ordained
priest and appointed lecturer in theology, succeeding to the
professoriate in 1820. In 1825 he became coadjutor bishop of
Killala, and in July 1834 archbishop of Tuam and metropolitan.
He visited Rome in 1831, and was there again at the proclamation
of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin (Dec.
1854) and in 1869-1870 at the Vatican council. Though he did
not favour the dogma of Papal Infallibility he submitted as soon
as it was defined. Machale was an intensely patriotic Irishman,
who fought hard for Catholic Emancipation, for separate Roman
Catholic schools, and against the Queen&rsquo;s Colleges. He translated
part of the <i>Iliad</i> (Dublin, 1861), and made an Irish version
of some of Moore&rsquo;s melodies and of the Pentateuch. He died at

<p><span class="bold">MACHAULT D&rsquo;ARNOUVILLE, JEAN BAPTISTE DE<a name="ar183" id="ar183"></a></span> (1701-1794),
French statesman, was a son of Louis Charles Machault
d&rsquo;Arnouville, lieutenant of police. In 1721 he was counsel to
the parlement of Paris, in 1728 <i>maître des requêtes</i>, and ten years
later was made president of the Great Council; although he had
opposed the court in the <i>Unigenitus</i> dispute, he was appointed
intendant of Hainaut in 1743. From this position, through
the influence at court of his old friend René Louis, Marquis
d&rsquo;Argenson, he was called to succeed Orry de Fulvy as controller-general
of the finances in December 1745. He found, on taking
office, that in the four years of the War of the Austrian Succession
the economies of Cardinal Fleury had been exhausted, and he
was forced to develop the system of borrowings which was bringing
French finances to bankruptcy. He attempted in 1749 a
reform in the levying of direct taxes, which, if carried out, would
have done much to prevent the later Revolutionary movement.
He proposed to abolish the old tax of a tenth, which was evaded
by the clergy and most of the nobility, and substitute a tax of
one-twentieth which should be levied on all without exception.
The cry for exceptions, however, began at once. The clergy
stood in a body by their historical privileges, and the outcry of
the nobility was too great for the minister to make headway
against. Still he managed to retain his office until July 1754,
when he exchanged the controllership for the ministry of marine.
Foreseeing the disastrous results of the alliance with Austria, he
was drawn to oppose more decidedly the schemes of Mme de
Pompadour, whose personal ill-will he had gained. Louis XV.
acquiesced in her demand for his disgrace on the 1st of February
1757. Machault lived on his estate at Arnouville until the
Revolution broke out, when, after a period of hiding, he was
apprehended in 1794 at Rouen and brought to Paris as a suspect.
He was imprisoned in the Madelonnettes, where he succumbed
in a few weeks, at the age of ninety-three.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Louis Charles Machault d&rsquo;Arnouville</span> (1737-1820),
was bishop of Amiens from 1774 until the Revolution.
He was famous for his charity; but proved to be a most uncompromising
Conservative at the estates general of 1789, where he
voted consistently against every reform. He emigrated in 1791,
resigned his bishopric in 1801 to facilitate the concordat, and
retired to the ancestral château of Arnouville, where he died in
1820.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACHAUT, GUILLAUME DE<a name="ar184" id="ar184"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1300-1377), French poet and
musician, was born in the village of Machault near Réthel in
Champagne. Machaut tells us that he served for thirty years
the adventurous John of Luxembourg, king of Bohemia. He
followed his master to Russia and Poland, and, though of peaceful
tastes himself, saw twenty battles and a hundred tourneys.
When John was killed at Crécy in 1346 Machaut was received at
the court of Normandy, and on the accession of John the Good to
the throne of France (1350) he received an office which enabled
him to devote himself thenceforth to music and poetry. Machaut
wrote about 1348 in honour of Charles III., king of Navarre, a
long poem much admired by contemporaries, <i>Le Jugement du roi
de Navarre</i>. When Charles was thrown into prison by his father-in-law,
King John, Machaut addressed him a <i>Confort d&rsquo;ami</i> to
console him for his enforced separation from his young wife,
then aged fifteen. This was followed about 1370 by a poem of
9000 lines entitled <i>La Prise d&rsquo;Alexandrie</i>, one of the last chronicles
cast in this form. Its hero was Pierre de Lusignan, king
of Cyprus. Machaut is best known for the strange book telling
of the love affair of his old age with a young and noble lady long
supposed to be Agnes of Navarre, sister of Charles the Bad;
Paulin Paris in his edition of the <i>Voir dit</i> (<i>Historie vraie</i>) identified
her as Perronne d&rsquo;Armentières, a noble lady of Champagne.
In 1362, when Machaut must have been at least sixty-two years
of age, he received a rondeau from Perronne, who was then
eighteen, expressing her devotion. She no doubt wished to
play Laura to his Petrarch, and the <i>Voir dit</i> contains the correspondence
and the poems which they exchanged. The romance,
which ended with Perronne&rsquo;s marriage and Machaut&rsquo;s desire
to remain her <i>doux ami</i>, has gleams of poetry, especially in
Perronne&rsquo;s verses, but its subject and its length are both
deterrent to modern readers. But Machaut with Deschamps
marks a distinct transition. The <i>trouvères</i> had been impersonal.
It is difficult to gather any details of their personal history
from their work. Machaut and Deschamps wrote of their own
affairs, and the next step in development was to be the self-analysis
of Villon. Machaut was also a musician. He composed
a number of motets, songs and ballads, also a mass
supposed to have been sung at the coronation of Charles V.
This was translated into modern notation by Perne, who read
a notice on it before the Institute of France in 1817.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACHIAVELLI, NICCOLÒ<a name="ar185" id="ar185"></a></span> (1469-1527), Italian statesman
and writer, was born at Florence on the 3rd of May 1469. His
ancestry claimed blood relationship with the lords of Montespertoli,
a fief situated between Val di Pesa and Val d&rsquo;Elsa, at
no great distance from the city. Niccolò&rsquo;s father, Bernardo
(b. 1428), followed the profession of a jurist. He held landed
property worth something like £250 a year of our money. His
son, though not wealthy, was never wholly dependent upon
official income.</p>

<p>Of Niccolò&rsquo;s early years and education little is known. His
works show wide reading in the Latin and Italian classics, but
it is almost certain that he had not mastered the Greek language.
To the defects of Machiavelli&rsquo;s education we may, in part at
least, ascribe the peculiar vigour of his style and his speculative
originality. He is free from the scholastic trifling and learned
frivolity which tainted the rhetorical culture of his century. He
made the world of men and things his study, learned to write
his mother-tongue with idiomatic conciseness, and nourished his
imagination on the masterpieces of the Romans.</p>

<p>The year of Charles VIII.&rsquo;s invasion and of the Medici&rsquo;s
expulsion from Florence (1494) saw Machiavelli&rsquo;s first entrance
into public life. He was appointed clerk in the second chancery
of the commune under his old master, the grammarian,
Marcello Virgilio Adriani. Early in 1498 Adriani became chancellor
of the republic, and Machiavelli received his vacated
office with the rank of second chancellor and secretary.
This post he retained till the year 1512. The masters he
had to serve were the <i>dieci di libertà e pace</i>, who, though
subordinate to the <i>signoria</i>, exercised a separate control
over the departments of war and the interior. They sent
their own ambassadors to foreign powers, transacted business
with the cities of the Florentine domain, and controlled the
military establishment of the commonwealth. The next fourteen
years of Machiavelli&rsquo;s life were fully occupied in the voluminous
correspondence of his bureau, in diplomatic missions of
varying importance, and in the organization of a Florentine
militia. It would be tedious to follow him through all his embassies
to petty courts of Italy, the first of which took place
in 1499, when he was sent to negotiate the continuance of a loan
to Catherine Sforza, countess of Forlì and Imola. In 1500
Machiavelli travelled into France, to deal with Louis XII. about
the affairs of Pisa. These embassies were the school in which
Machiavelli formed his political opinions, and gathered views
regarding the state of Europe and the relative strength of nations.
They not only introduced him to the subtleties of Italian diplomacy,
but also extended his observation over races very different
from the Italians. He thus, in the course of his official business,
gradually acquired principles and settled ways of thinking which
he afterwards expressed in writing.</p>

<p>In 1502 Machiavelli married Marietta Corsini, who bore him
several children, with whom, in spite of his own infidelities, he
lived on good terms, and who survived him twenty-six years. In
the same year Piero Soderini was chosen gonfalonier for life, in
accordance with certain changes in the constitution of the state,
which were intended to bring Florence closer to the Venetian
type of government. Machiavelli became intimately connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>
with Soderini, assisted him in carrying out his policy, suggested
important measures of military reform which Soderini adopted,
and finally was involved in ruin by his fall.</p>

<p>The year 1502 was marked by yet another decisive incident in
Machiavelli&rsquo;s life. In October he was sent, much against his
will, as envoy to the camp of Cesare Borgia, duke of Valentinois.
The duke was then in Romagna, and it was Machiavelli&rsquo;s duty
to wait upon and watch him. He was able now to observe those
intricate intrigues which culminated in Cesare&rsquo;s murder of his
disaffected captains. From what remains of Machiavelli&rsquo;s
official letters, and from his tract upon the <i>Modo che tenne il
duca Valentino per ammazzar Vitellozzo Vitelli</i>, we are able to
appreciate the actual relations which existed between the two
men, and the growth in Machiavelli&rsquo;s mind of a political ideal
based upon his study of the duke&rsquo;s character. Machiavelli
conceived the strongest admiration for Cesare&rsquo;s combination of
audacity with diplomatic prudence, for his adroit use of cruelty
and fraud, for his self-reliance, avoidance of half-measures,
employment of native troops, and firm administration in conquered
provinces. More than once, in letters to his friend
Vettori, no less than in the pages of the <i>Principe</i>, Machiavelli
afterwards expressed his belief that Cesare Borgia&rsquo;s behaviour
in the conquest of provinces, the cementing of a new state out of
scattered elements, and the dealing with false friends or doubtful
allies, was worthy of all commendation and of scrupulous imitation.
As he watched Cesare Borgia at this, the most brilliant
period of his adventurous career, the man became idealized in
his reflective but imaginative mind. Round him, as a hero, he
allowed his own conceptions of the perfect prince to cluster.
That Machiavelli separated the actual Cesare Borgia, whom he
afterwards saw, ruined and contemptible, at Rome, from this
radiant creature of his political fancy, is probable. That the
Cesare of history does not exactly match the Duca Valentino of
Machiavelli&rsquo;s writings is certain. Still the fact remains that
henceforth Machiavelli cherished the ideal image of the statesman
which he had modelled upon Cesare, and called this by the name
of Valentino.</p>

<p>On his return to Florence early in January 1503, Machiavelli
began to occupy himself with a project which his recent attendance
upon Cesare Borgia had strengthened in his mind. The
duties of his office obliged him to study the conditions of military
service as they then existed in Italy. He was familiar with the
disadvantages under which republics laboured when they engaged
professional captains of adventure and levied mercenary troops.
The bad faith of the condottiere Paolo Vitelli (beheaded at
Florence in 1499) had deeply impressed him. In the war with
Pisa he had observed the insubordination and untrustworthiness
of soldiers gathered from the dregs of different districts, serving
under egotistical and irresponsible commanders. His reading
in Livy taught him to admire the Roman system of employing
armies raised from the body of the citizens; and Cesare Borgia&rsquo;s
method of gradually substituting the troops of his own duchy
for aliens and mercenaries showed him that this plan might be
adopted with success by the Italians. He was now determined,
if possible, to furnish Florence with a national militia. The
gonfalonier Soderini entered into his views. But obstacles of no
small magnitude arose. The question of money was immediately
pressing. Early in 1503 Machiavelli drew up for Soderini a
speech, <i>Discorso sulla provisione del danaro</i>, in which the duty and
necessity of liberal expenditure for the protection of the state
were expounded upon principles of sound political philosophy.
Between this date and the last month of 1506 Machiavelli
laboured at his favourite scheme, working out memorials on the
subject for his office, and suggesting the outlines of a new military
organization. On the 6th of December 1506 his plan was approved
by the signoria, and a special ministry, called the nove
<i>di ordinanza e milizia</i>, was appointed. Machiavelli immediately
became their secretary. The country districts of the Florentine
dominion were now divided into departments, and levies of foot
soldiers were made in order to secure a standing militia. A
commander-in-chief had to be chosen for the new troops.
Italian jealousy shrank from conferring this important office
on a Florentine, lest one member of the state should acquire a
power dangerous to the whole. The choice of Soderini and
Machiavelli fell, at this juncture, upon an extremely ineligible
person, none other than Don Micheletto, Cesare Borgia&rsquo;s cut-throat
and assassin. It is necessary to insist upon this point,
since it serves to illustrate a radical infirmity in Machiavelli&rsquo;s
genius. While forming and promoting his scheme, he was
actuated by principles of political wisdom and by the purest
patriotism. But he failed to perceive that such a ruffian as
Micheletto could not inspire the troops of Florence with that
devotion to their country and that healthy moral tone which
should distinguish a patriot army. Here, as elsewhere, he revealed
his insensibility to the ethical element in human nature.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Italy had been the scene of memorable events, in
most of which Machiavelli took some part. Alexander VI. had
died suddenly of fever. Julius II. had ascended the papal
chair. The duke of Valentinois had been checked in mid-career
of conquest. The collapse of the Borgias threw Central Italy
into confusion; and Machiavelli had, in 1505, to visit the
Baglioni at Perugia and the Petrucci at Siena. In the following
year he accompanied Julius upon his march through Perugia
into the province of Emilia, where the fiery pope subdued in
person the rebellious cities of the Church. Upon these embassies
Machiavelli represented the Florentine dieci in quality of envoy.
It was his duty to keep the ministry informed by means of
frequent despatches and reports. All this while the war for the
recovery of Pisa was slowly dragging on, with no success or
honour to the Florentines. Machiavelli had to attend the camp
and provide for levies amid his many other occupations. And
yet he found time for private literary work. In the autumn of
1504 he began his <i>Decennali</i>, or <i>Annals of Italy</i>, a poem composed
in rough terza rima. About the same time he composed a
comedy on the model of Aristophanes, which is unfortunately
lost. It seems to have been called <i>Le Maschere</i>. Giuliano de&rsquo;
Ricci tells us it was marked by stringent satire upon great ecclesiastics
and statesmen, no less than by a tendency to &ldquo;ascribe
all human things to natural causes or to fortune.&rdquo; That phrase
accurately describes the prevalent bias of its author&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>The greater part of 1506 and 1507 was spent in organizing the
new militia, corresponding on the subject, and scouring the country
on enlistment service. But at the end of the latter year
European affairs of no small moment diverted Machiavelli from
these humbler duties. Maximilian was planning a journey into
Italy in order to be crowned emperor at Rome, and was levying
subsidies from the imperial burghs for his expenses. The
Florentines thought his demands excessive. Though they
already had Francesco Vettori at his court, Soderini judged it
advisable to send Machiavelli thither in December. He travelled
by Geneva, all through Switzerland, to Botzen, where he
found the emperor. This journey was an important moment
in his life. It enabled him to study the Swiss and the Germans
in their homes; and the report which he wrote on his return is
among his most effective political studies. What is most remarkable
in it is his concentrated effort to realize the exact political
weight of the German nation, and to penetrate the causes of its
strength and weakness. He attempts to grasp the national
character as a whole, and thence to deduce practical conclusions.
The same qualities are noticeable in his <i>Ritratti delle cose di
Francia</i>, which he drew up after an embassy to Louis XII. at
Blois in 1510. These notes upon the French race are more
scattered than the report on German affairs. But they reveal
no less acumen combined with imaginative penetration into the
very essence of national existence.</p>

<p><span class="correction" title="amended from Michiavelli">Machiavelli</span> returned from Germany in June 1508. The rest
of that year and a large part of 1509 were spent in the affairs of
the militia and the war of Pisa. Chiefly through his exertions
the war was terminated by the surrender of Pisa in June 1509.
Meanwhile the league of Cambray had disturbed the peace of
Italy, and Florence found herself in a perilous position between
Spain and France. Soderini&rsquo;s government grew weaker. The
Medicean party lifted up its head. To the league of Cambray
succeeded the Holy League. The battle of Ravenna was fought,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>
and the French retired from Italy. The Florentines had been
spectators rather than actors in these great events. But they
were now destined to feel the full effects of them. The cardinal
Giovanni de&rsquo; Medici, who was present at the battle of Ravenna,
brought a Spanish army into Tuscany. Prato was sacked in
the August of 1512. Florence, in extreme terror, deposed the
gonfalonier, and opened her gates to the princes of the house of
Medici.</p>

<p>The government on which Machiavelli depended had fallen,
never to rise again. The national militia in which he placed
unbounded confidence had proved inefficient to protect Florence
in the hour of need. He was surrounded by political and personal
enemies, who regarded him with jealousy as the ex-gonfalonier&rsquo;s
right-hand man. Yet at first it appears that he still
hoped to retain his office. He showed no repugnance to a change
of masters, and began to make overtures to the Medici. The
<i>nove della milizia</i> were, however, dissolved; and on the 7th of
November 1512 Machiavelli was deprived of his appointments.
He was exiled from Florence and confined to the dominion for
one year, and on the 17th of November was <span class="correction" title="amended from futher">further</span> prohibited
from setting foot in the Palazzo Pubblico. Ruin stared him in
the face; and, to make matters worse, he was implicated in the
conspiracy of Pier Paolo Boscoli in February 1513. Machiavelli
had taken no share in that feeble attempt against the Medici,
but his name was found upon a memorandum dropped by
Boscoli. This was enough to ensure his imprisonment. He
was racked, and only released upon Giovanni de&rsquo; Medici&rsquo;s
election to the papacy in March 1513. When he left his dungeon
he retired to a farm near San Casciano, and faced the fact that
his political career was at an end.</p>

<p>Machiavelli now entered upon a period of life to which we owe
the great works that have rendered his name immortal. But it
was one of prolonged disappointment and annoyance. He had
not accustomed himself to economical living; and, when the
emoluments of his office were withdrawn, he had barely enough
to support his family. The previous years of his manhood had
been spent in continual activity. Much as he enjoyed the
study of the Latin and Italian classics, literature was not his
business; nor had he looked on writing as more than an occasional
amusement. He was now driven in upon his books for the employment
of a restless temperament; and to this irksomeness of
enforced leisure may be ascribed the production of the <i>Principe</i>,
the <i>Discorsi</i>, the <i>Arte della guerra</i>, the comedies, and the <i>Historie
fiorentine</i>. The uneasiness of Machiavelli&rsquo;s mind in the first
years of this retirement is brought before us by his private correspondence.
The letters to Vettori paint a man of vigorous
intellect and feverish activity, dividing his time between studies
and vulgar dissipations, seeking at one time distraction in low
intrigues and wanton company, at another turning to the great
minds of antiquity for solace. It is not easy to understand the
spirit in which the author of the <i>Principe</i> sat down to exchange
obscenities with the author of the <i>Sommario della storia d&rsquo;Italia</i>.
At the same time this coarseness of taste did not blunt his intellectual
sagacity. His letters on public affairs in Italy and Europe,
especially those which he meant Vettori to communicate to the
Medici at Rome, are marked by extraordinary fineness of perception,
combined, as usual in his case, with philosophical breadth.
In retirement at his villa near Percussina, a hamlet of San
Casciano, Machiavelli completed the <i>Principe</i> before the end of
1513. This famous book is an analysis of the methods whereby
an ambitious man may rise to sovereign power. It appears to
have grown out of another scarcely less celebrated work, upon
which Machiavelli had been engaged before he took the <i>Principe</i>
in hand, and which he did not finish until some time afterwards.
This second treatise is the <i>Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito
Livio</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Cast in the form of comments on the history of Livy, the <i>Discorsi</i>
are really an inquiry into the genesis and maintenance of states.
The <i>Principe</i> is an offshoot from the main theme of the <i>Discorsi</i>,
setting forth Machiavelli&rsquo;s views at large and in detail upon the
nature of principalities, the method of cementing them, and the
qualities of a successful autocrat. Being more limited in subject
and more independent as a work of literary art, this essay detaches
itself from the main body of the <i>Discorsi</i>, and has attracted far more
attention. We feel that the <i>Principe</i> is inspired with greater
fervency, as though its author had more than a speculative aim in
view, and brought it forth to serve a special crisis. The moment of
its composition was indeed decisive. Machiavelli judged the case
of Italy so desperate that salvation could only be expected from the
intervention of a powerful despot. The unification of Italy in a
state protected by a national army was the cherished dream of his
life; and the peroration of the <i>Principe</i> shows that he meant this
treatise to have a direct bearing on the problem. We must be careful,
however, not to fall into the error of supposing that he wrote
it with the sole object of meeting an occasional emergency. Together
with the <i>Discorsi</i>, the <i>Principe</i> contains the speculative fruits of his
experience and observation combined with his deductions from
Roman history. The two works form one coherent body of opinion,
not systematically expressed, it is true, but based on the same
principles, involving the same conclusions, and directed to the same
philosophical end. That end is the analysis of the conception of
the state, studied under two main types, republican and monarchical.
Up to the date of Machiavelli, modern political philosophy had
always presupposed an ideal. Medieval speculation took the Church
and the Empire for granted, as divinely appointed institutions,
under which the nations of the earth must flourish for the space of
man&rsquo;s probation on this planet. Thinkers differed only as Guelfs
and Ghibellines, as leaning on the one side to papal, on the other
to imperial supremacy. In the revival of learning, scholarship
supplanted scholasticism, and the old ways of medieval thinking
were forgotten. But no substantial philosophy of any kind emerged
from humanism; the political lucubrations of the scholars were,
like their ethical treatises, for the most part rhetorical. Still the
humanists effected a delivery of the intellect from what had become
the bondage of obsolete ideas, and created a new medium for the
speculative faculty. Simultaneously with the revival, Italy had
passed into that stage of her existence which has been called the
age of despots. The yoke of the Empire had been shaken off. The
Church had taken rank among Italian tyrannies. The peninsula
was, roughly speaking, divided into principalities and sovereign
cities, each of which claimed autocratic jurisdiction. These separate
despotisms owned no common social tie, were founded on no common
<i>jus</i> or right, but were connected in a network of conflicting interests
and changeful diplomatic combinations. A keen and positive
political intelligence emerged in the Italian race. The reports of
Venetian and Florentine ambassadors at this epoch contain the first
germs of an attempt to study politics from the point of view of
science.</p>

<p>At this moment Machiavelli intervenes. He was conscious of the
change which had come over Italy and Europe. He was aware that
the old strongholds of medieval thought must be abandoned, and
that the decaying ruins of medieval institutions furnished no basis
for the erection of solid political edifices. He felt the corruption
of his country, and sought to bring the world back to a lively sense
of the necessity for reformation. His originality consists in having
extended the positive intelligence of his century from the sphere of
contemporary politics and special interests to man at large regarded
as a political being. He founded the science of politics for the
modern world, by concentrating thought upon its fundamental
principles. He began to study men, not according to some preconception,
but as he found them&mdash;men, not in the isolation of one
century, but as a whole in history. He drew his conclusions from
the nature of mankind itself, &ldquo;ascribing all things to natural causes
or to fortune.&rdquo; In this way he restored the right method of study,
a method which had been neglected since the days of Aristotle. He
formed a conception of the modern state, which marked the close
of the middle ages, and anticipated the next phase of European
development. His prince, abating those points which are purely
Italian or strongly tinctured with the author&rsquo;s personal peculiarities,
prefigured the monarchs of the 16th and 17th centuries, the monarchs
whose motto was <i>L&rsquo;état c&rsquo;est moi!</i> His doctrine of a national militia
foreshadowed the system which has given strength in arms to France
and Germany. His insight into the causes of Italian decadence
was complete; and the remedies which he suggested, in the perorations
of the <i>Principe</i> and the <i>Arte della guerra</i>, have since been
applied in the unification of Italy. Lastly, when we once have freed
ourselves from the antipathy engendered by his severance of ethics
from the field of politics, when we have once made proper allowance
for his peculiar use of phrases like <i>frodi onorevoli</i> or <i>scelleratezze
gloriose</i>, nothing is left but admiration for his mental attitude. That
is the attitude of a patriot, who saw with open eyes the ruin of his
country, who burned above all things to save Italy and set her in
her place among the powerful nations, who held the duty of self-sacrifice
in the most absolute sense, whose very limitations and
mistakes were due to an absorbing passion for the state he dreamed
might be reconstituted. It was Machiavelli&rsquo;s intense preoccupation
with this problem&mdash;what a state is and how to found one in existing
circumstances&mdash;which caused the many riddles of his speculative
writings. Dazzled, as it were, with the brilliancy of his own discovery,
concentrated in attention on the one necessity for organizing
a powerful coherent nation, he forgot that men are more than
political beings. He neglected religion, or regarded it as part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span>
the state machinery. He was by no means indifferent to private
virtue, which indeed he judged the basis of all healthy national existence;
but in the realm of politics he postponed morals to political
expediency. He held that the people, as distinguished from the
nobles and the clergy, were the pith and fibre of nations; yet this
same people had to become wax in the hands of the politician&mdash;their
commerce and their comforts, the arts which give a dignity
to life and the pleasures which make life liveable, neglected&mdash;their
very liberty subordinated to the one tyrannical conception. To
this point the segregation of politics from every other factor which
goes to constitute humanity had brought him; and this it is which
makes us feel his world a wilderness, devoid of atmosphere and
vegetation. Yet some such isolation of the subject matter of this
science was demanded at the moment of its birth, just as political
economy, when first started, had to make a rigid severance of wealth
from other units. It is only by a gradual process that social science
in its whole complexity can be evolved. We have hardly yet discovered
that political economy has unavoidable points of contact
with ethics.</p>

<p>From the foregoing criticism it will be perceived that all the
questions whether Machiavelli meant to corrupt or to instruct the
world, to fortify the hands of tyrants or to lead them to their ruin,
are now obsolete. He was a man of science&mdash;one who by the
vigorous study of his subject matter sought from that subject-matter
itself to deduce laws. The difficulty which remains in
judging him is a difficulty of statement, valuation, allowance. How
much shall we allow for his position in Renaissance Italy, for the
corruption in the midst of which he lived, for his own personal
temperament? How shall we state his point of departure from
the middle ages, his sympathy with prevalent classical enthusiasms,
his divination of a new period? How shall we estimate the permanent
worth of his method, the residuum of value in his maxims?</p>
</div>

<p>After finishing the <i>Principe</i>, Machiavelli thought of dedicating
it to one of the Medicean princes, with the avowed hope that he
might thereby regain their favour and find public employment.
He wrote to Vettori on the subject, and Giuliano de&rsquo; Medici,
duke of Nemours, seemed to him the proper person. The choice
was reasonable. No sooner had Leo been made pope than he
formed schemes for the aggrandizement of his family. Giuliano
was offered and refused the duchy of Urbino. Later on, Leo
designed for him a duchy in Emilia, to be cemented out of Parma,
Piacenza, Reggio and Modena. Supported by the power of the
papacy, with the goodwill of Florence to back him, Giuliano
would have found himself in a position somewhat better than that
of Cesare Borgia; and Borgia&rsquo;s creation of the duchy of Romagna
might have served as his model. Machiavelli therefore was justified
in feeling that here was an opportunity for putting his cherished
schemes in practice, and that a prince with such alliances
might even advance to the grand end of the unification of Italy.
Giuliano, however, died in 1506. Then Machiavelli turned his
thoughts towards Lorenzo, duke of Urbino. The choice of this
man as a possible Italian liberator reminds us of the choice of
Don Micheletto as general of the Florentine militia. To Lorenzo
the <i>Principe</i> was dedicated, but without result. The Medici,
as yet at all events, could not employ Machiavelli, and had not
in themselves the stuff to found Italian kingdoms.</p>

<p>Machiavelli, meanwhile, was reading his <i>Discorsi</i> to a select
audience in the Rucellai gardens, fanning that republican enthusiasm
which never lay long dormant among the Florentines.
Towards the year 1519 both Leo X. and his cousin, the cardinal
Giulio de&rsquo; Medici, were much perplexed about the management
of the republic. It seemed necessary, if possible, in the gradual
extinction of their family to give the city at least a semblance of
self-government. They applied to several celebrated politicians,
among others to Machiavelli, for advice in the emergency. The
result was a treatise in which he deduced practical conclusions
from the past history and present temper of the city, blending
these with his favourite principles of government in general.
He earnestly admonished Leo, for his own sake and for Florence,
to found a permanent and free state system for the republic,
reminding him in terms of noble eloquence how splendid is the
glory of the man who shall confer such benefits upon a people.
The year 1520 saw the composition of the <i>Arte della guerra</i> and
the <i>Vita di Castruccio</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The first of these is a methodical treatise, setting forth
Machiavelli&rsquo;s views on military matters, digesting his theories
respecting the superiority of national troops, the inefficiency of
fortresses, the necessity of relying upon infantry in war, and the
comparative insignificance of artillery. It is strongly coloured with
his enthusiasm for ancient Rome; and specially upon the topic of
artillery it displays a want of insight into the actualities of modern
warfare. We may regard it as a supplement or appendix to the
<i>Principe</i> and the <i>Discorsi</i>, since Machiavelli held it for a fundamental
axiom that states are powerless unless completely armed in permanence.
The peroration contains a noble appeal to the Italian liberator
of his dreams, and a parallel from Macedonian history, which, read
by the light of this century, sounds like a prophecy of Piedmont.</p>

<p>The <i>Vita di Castruccio</i> was composed at Lucca, whither Machiavelli
had been sent on a mission. This so-called biography of the
medieval adventurer who raised himself by personal ability and
military skill to the tyranny of several Tuscan cities must be
regarded in the light of an historical romance. Dealing freely with
the outline of Castruccio&rsquo;s career, as he had previously dealt with
Cesare Borgia, he sketched his own ideal of the successful prince.
Cesare Borgia had entered into the <i>Principe</i> as a representative figure
rather than an actual personage; so now conversely the theories of
the <i>Principe</i> assumed the outward form and semblance of Castruccio.
In each case history is blent with speculation in nearly the same
proportions. But Castruccio, being farther from the writer&rsquo;s own
experience, bears weaker traits of personality.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1520, Machiavelli, at the instance of the cardinal
Giulio de&rsquo; Medici, received commission from the officers of the <i>Studio
pubblico</i> to write a history of Florence. They agreed to pay him
an annual allowance of 100 florins while engaged upon the work.
The next six years were partly employed in its composition, and
he left a portion of it finished, with a dedication to Clement VII.,
when he died in 1527. In the <i>Historie fiorentine</i> Machiavelli quitted
the field of political speculation for that of history. But, having
already written the <i>Discorsi</i> and the <i>Principe</i>, he carried with him to
this new task of historiography the habit of mind proper to political
philosophy. In his hands the history of Florence became a text
on which at fitting seasons to deliver lessons in the science he initiated.
This gives the work its special character. It is not so much
a chronicle of Florentine affairs, from the commencement of modern
history to the death of Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici in 1492, as a critique of
that chronicle from the point of view adopted by Machiavelli in his
former writings. Having condensed his doctrines in the <i>Principe</i>
and the <i>Discorsi</i>, he applies their abstract principles to the example
of the Florentine republic. But the <i>History of Florence</i> is not a mere
political pamphlet. It is the first example in Italian literature of
a national biography, the first attempt in any literature to trace the
vicissitudes of a people&rsquo;s life in their logical sequence, deducing
each successive phase from passions or necessities inherent in preceding
circumstances, reasoning upon them from general principles,
and inferring corollaries for the conduct of the future. In point of
form the <i>Florentine History</i> is modelled upon Livy. It contains
speeches in the antique manner, which may be taken partly as
embodying the author&rsquo;s commentary upon situations of importance,
partly as expressing what he thought dramatically appropriate to
prominent personages. The style of the whole book is nervous,
vivid, free from artifice and rhetoric, obeying the writer&rsquo;s thought
with absolute plasticity. Machiavelli had formed for himself a
prose style, equalled by no one but by Guicciardini in his minor
works, which was far removed from the emptiness of the latinizing
humanists and the trivialities of the Italian purists. Words in his
hands have the substance, the self-evidence of things. It is an
athlete&rsquo;s style, all bone and sinew, nude, without superfluous flesh
or ornament.</p>
</div>

<p>It would seem that from the date of Machiavelli&rsquo;s discourse
to Leo on the government of Florence the Medici had taken him
into consideration. Writing to Vettori in 1513, he had expressed
his eager wish to &ldquo;roll stones&rdquo; in their service; and this desire
was now gratified. In 1521 he was sent to Carpi to transact a
petty matter with the chapter of the Franciscans, the chief known
result of the embassy being a burlesque correspondence with
Francesco Guicciardini. Four years later, in 1525, he received
a rather more important mission to Venice. But Machiavelli&rsquo;s
public career was virtually closed; and the interest of his biography
still centres in his literary work. We have seen that
already, in 1504, he had been engaged upon a comedy in the
manner of Aristophanes, which is now unfortunately lost. A
translation of the <i>Andria</i> and three original comedies from his
pen are extant, the precise dates of which are uncertain, though
the greatest of them was first printed at Rome in 1524. This is
the <i>Mandragola</i>, which may be justly called the ripest and most
powerful play in the Italian language.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The plot is both improbable and unpleasing. But literary
criticism is merged in admiration of the wit, the humour, the
vivacity, the satire of a piece which brings before us the old life of
Florence in a succession of brilliant scenes. If Machiavelli had any
moral object when he composed the <i>Mandragola</i>, it was to paint in
glaring colours the corruption of Italian society. It shows how a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>237</span>
bold and plausible adventurer, aided by the profligacy of a parasite,
the avarice and hypocrisy of a confessor, and a mother&rsquo;s complaisant
familiarity with vice, achieves the triumph of making a gulled
husband bring his own unwilling but too yielding wife to shame.
The whole comedy is a study of stupidity and baseness acted on by
roguery. About the power with which this picture of domestic
immorality is presented there can be no question. But the perusal
of the piece obliges us to ask ourselves whether the author&rsquo;s radical
conception of human nature was not false. The same suspicion is
forced upon us by the <i>Principe</i>. Did not Machiavelli leave good
habit, as an essential ingredient of character, out of account? Men
are not such absolute fools as Nicia, nor such compliant catspaws
as Ligurio and Timoteo; women are not such weak instruments as
Sostrata and Lucrezia. Somewhere, in actual life, the stress of
craft and courage acting on the springs of human vice and weakness
fails, unless the hero of the comedy or tragedy, Callimaco or Cesare,
allows for the revolt of healthier instincts. Machiavelli does not
seem to have calculated the force of this recoil. He speculates a
world in which <i>virtù</i>, unscrupulous strength of character, shall deal
successfully with frailty. This, we submit, was a deep-seated error
in his theory of life, an error to which may be ascribed the numerous
stumbling-blocks and rocks of offence in his more serious writings.</p>

<p>Some time after the <i>Mandragola</i>, he composed a second comedy,
entitled <i>Clizia</i>, which is even homelier and closer to the life of
Florence than its predecessor. It contains incomparable studies
of the Florentine housewife and her husband, a grave business-like
citizen, who falls into the senile folly of a base intrigue. There
remains a short piece without title, the <i>Commedia in prosa</i>, which,
if it be Machiavelli&rsquo;s, as internal evidence of style sufficiently argues,
might be accepted as a study for both the <i>Clizia</i> and the <i>Mandragola</i>.
It seems written to expose the corruption of domestic life in Florence,
and especially to satirize the friars in their <span class="correction" title="amended from familar">familiar</span> part of go-betweens,
tame cats, confessors and adulterers.</p>

<p>Of Machiavelli&rsquo;s minor poems, sonnets, <i>capitoli</i> and carnival
songs there is not much to say. Powerful as a comic playwright,
he was not a poet in the proper sense of the term. The little novel
of <i>Belfagor</i> claims a passing word, if only because of its celebrity.
It is a good-humoured satire upon marriage, the devil being forced
to admit that hell itself is preferable to his wife&rsquo;s company. That
Machiavelli invented it to express the irritation of his own domestic
life is a myth without foundation. The story has a medieval origin,
and it was almost simultaneously treated in Italian by Machiavelli,
Straparola and Giovanni Brevio.</p>
</div>

<p>In the spring of 1526 Machiavelli was employed by
Clement VII. to inspect the fortifications of Florence. He
presented a report upon the subject, and in the summer of
the same year received orders to attend Francesco Guicciardini,
the pope&rsquo;s commissary of war in Lombardy. Guicciardini
sent him in August to Cremona, to transact business with the
Venetian <i>provveditori</i>. Later on in the autumn we find him
once more with Guicciardini at Bologna. Thus the two great
Italian historians of the 16th century, who had been friends
for several years, were brought into relations of close intimacy.</p>

<p>After another visit to Guicciardini in the spring of 1527,
Machiavelli was sent by him to Civita Vecchia. It seemed that he
was destined to be associated in the papal service with Clement&rsquo;s
viceroy, and that a new period of diplomatic employment was
opening for him. But soon after his return to Florence he fell
ill. His son Piero said that he took medicine on the 20th of
June which disagreed with him; and on the 22nd he died,
having received the last offices of the Church.</p>

<p>There is no foundation for the legend that he expired with
profane sarcasms upon his lips. Yet we need not run into the
opposite extreme, and try to fancy that Machiavelli, who had
professed Paganism in his life, proved himself a believing
Christian on his death-bed. That he left an unfavourable
opinion among his fellow citizens is very decidedly recorded
by the historian Varchi. The <i>Principe</i>, it seems, had already
begun to prejudice the world against him; and we can readily
believe that Varchi sententiously observes, that &ldquo;it would
have been better for him if nature had given him either a less
powerful intellect or a mind of a more genial temper.&rdquo; There
is in truth a something crude, unsympathetic, cynical in his
mental attitude toward human nature, for which, even after
the lapse of more than three centuries, we find it difficult to
make allowance. The force of his intellect renders this want
of geniality repulsive. We cannot help objecting that one
who was so powerful could have been kindlier and sounder if
he willed. We therefore do him the injustice of mistaking his
infirmity for perversity. He was colour-blind to commonplace
morality; and we are angry with him because he merged the
hues of ethics in one grey monotone of politics.</p>

<p>In person Machiavelli was of middle height, black-haired,
with rather a small head, very bright eyes and slightly aquiline
nose. His thin, close lips often broke into a smile of sarcasm.
His activity was almost feverish. When unemployed in work
or study he was not averse to the society of boon companions,
gave himself readily to transient amours, and corresponded in
a tone of cynical bad taste. At the same time he lived on
terms of intimacy with worthy men. Varchi says that &ldquo;in
his conversation he was pleasant, obliging to his intimates, the
friend of virtuous persons.&rdquo; Those who care to understand
the contradictions of which such a character was capable should
study his correspondence with Vettori. It would be unfair to
charge what is repulsive in their letters wholly on the habits
of the times, for wide familiarity with the published correspondence
of similar men at the same epoch brings one
acquainted with little that is so disagreeable.</p>

modification of force to a specific purpose. The term &ldquo;simple
machine&rdquo; is applied to the six so-called mechanical powers&mdash;the
lever, wedge, wheel and axle, pulley, screw, and inclined
plane. For machine-tools see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tools</a></span>. The word machine was
formerly applied to vehicles, such as stage-coaches, &amp;c., and is
still applied to carriages in Scotland; a survival of this use
is in the term &ldquo;bathing machine.&rdquo; Figuratively, the word is
used of persons whose actions seem to be regulated according
to a rigid and unchanging system. In politics, especially in
America, machine is synonymous with party organization. A
stage device of the ancient Greek drama gave rise to the proverbial
expression, &ldquo;the god from the machine,&rdquo; Lat. <i>deus ex
machina</i>, for the disentangling and conclusion of a plot by
supernatural interference or by some accident extraneous to
the natural development of the story. When a god had to be
brought on the stage he was floated down from above by a

p. 245 seq.) that only in two plays (<i>Orestes</i> and <i>Hippolytus</i>) is
the god brought on for the solution of the plot. In the others

future story of the characters, or to introduce some account of a
legend, institution, &amp;c.</p>

machine-guns was hand operated, but all modern weapons are
automatic in action, the gas of the explosion or the force of

smaller types approximate to the &ldquo;automatic rifle,&rdquo; which is
expected to replace the magazine rifle as the arm of the infantryman.
The large types, generically called &ldquo;pompoms,&rdquo; fire a
light artillery projectile, and are considered by many artillery
experts as &ldquo;the gun of the future.&rdquo; The medium type, which
takes the ordinary rifle ammunition but is fired from various
forms of carriage, is the ordinary machine-gun of to-day, and
the present article deals mainly with this.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">Historical Sketch</span></p>

<p>Machine-guns of a primitive kind are found in the early history
of gunpowder artillery, in the form of a grouping or binding of
several small-calibre guns for purposes of a volley or a rapid
succession of shots. The earliest field artillery (<i>q.v.</i>) was indeed
chiefly designed to serve the purpose of a modern machine-gun,
<i>i.e.</i> for a mechanical concentration of musketry. Infantry fire
(till the development of the Spanish arquebus, about 1520) was
almost ineffective, and the disintegration of the masses of pikes,
preparatory to the decisive cavalry charge, had to be effected
by guns of one sort or another (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Infantry</a></span>). Hence the
&ldquo;cart with gonnes,&rdquo; although the prototype of the field gun of
to-day was actually a primitive <i>mitrailleuse</i>.</p>

<p>Weapons of this sort were freely employed by the Hussites,
who fought in laager formation (<i>Wagenburg</i>), but the fitting of
two or more hand-guns or small culverins to a two-wheeled
carriage garnished with spikes and scythe blades (like the ancient
war-chariots) was somewhat older, for in 1382 the men of Ghent
put into the field 200 &ldquo;chars de canon&rdquo; and in 1411 the Burgundian
army is said to have had 2000 &ldquo;ribaudequins&rdquo; (meaning
probably the weapons, not the carts, in this case). These
were of course hardly more than carts with hand-gun men; in
fact most armies in those days moved about in a hollow square
or lozenge of wagons, and it was natural to fill the carts with
the available gunners or archers. The method of breaking the
enemy&rsquo;s &ldquo;battles&rdquo; with these carts was at first, in the ancient
manner, to drive into and disorder the hostile ranks with the
<span class="sidenote">Ribaudequins.</span>
scythes. But they contained at least the germ of
the modern machine-gun, for the tubes (<i>cannes,
canons</i>) were connected by a train of powder and fired
in volleys. As however field artillery improved (latter half of 15th
century), and a cannon-ball could be fired from a mobile carriage,
the ribaudequin ceased to exist, its name being transferred to
heavy hand-guns used as rampart pieces. The idea of the machine-gun
reappeared however in the 16th century. The weapons were
now called &ldquo;organs&rdquo; (<i>orgues</i>), from the number of pipes or tubes
that they contained. At first used (defensively) in the same way
as the ribaudequins, <i>i.e.</i> as an effective addition to the military
equipment of a war-cart, they were developed, in the early part of
the 16th century, into a really formidable weapon for breaking
the masses of the enemy, not by scythes and spikes but by fire.
Fleurange&rsquo;s memoirs assign the credit of this to the famous
gunner and engineer Pedro Navarro, who made two hundred
weapons of a design of his own for Louis XII. These &ldquo;were
not more than two feet long, and fired fifty shots at a round,&rdquo;
but nevertheless &ldquo;organs&rdquo; were relatively rare in the armies
of the 16th century, for the field artillery, though it grew in
size and lost in mobility, had discovered the efficacy of case
shot (then called &ldquo;perdreaux&rdquo;) against uncovered animate
targets, and for work that was not sufficiently serious for the
guns heavy arquebuses were employed. Infantry fire, too,
was growing in power and importance. In 1551 a French army
contained 21 guns and 150 arquebuses <i>à croc</i> and one <i>pièce façon
d&rsquo;orgue</i>. By about 1570 it had been found that when an &ldquo;organ&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote">&ldquo;Organs.&rdquo;]</span>
was needed all that was necessary was to mount some
heavy arquebuses on a cart, and the organ, as a
separate weapon, disappeared from the field, although under the
name of &ldquo;mantelet&rdquo; (from the shield which protected the
gunners), it was still used for the defence of breaches in siege warfare.
Diego Ufano, who wrote in the early years of the 17th century,
describes it as a weapon consisting of five or six barrels fired simultaneously
by a common lock, and mentions as a celebrated example
the &ldquo;Triquetraque of Rome&rdquo; which had five barrels. Another
writer, Hanzelet, describes amongst other devices a mitrailleuse
of four barrels which was fired from the back of an ass or pony.
But such weapons as these were more curious than useful.
For work in the open field the musket came more and more to
the front, its bullet became at least as formidable as that of an
&ldquo;organ,&rdquo; and when it was necessary to obtain a concentrated
fire on a narrow front arquebuses <i>à croc</i> were mounted for the
nonce in groups of four to six. The &ldquo;organ&rdquo; maintained a
precarious existence, and is described by Montecucculi a century
later, and one of twelve barrels figures in the list of military
Stores at Hesdin in 1689. But its fatal defect was that it
was neither powerful enough to engage nor mobile enough to
evade the hostile artillery.</p>

<p>Enthusiastic inventors, of course, produced many models of
machine-gun in the strict sense of the word&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> a gun firing
many charges, in volleys or in rapid succession, by a mechanical
arrangement of the lock. Wilhelm Calthoff, a German employed
by Louis XIII., produced arquebuses and muskets that fired
six to eight shots per round, but his invention was a secret,
and it seems to have been more of a magazine small arm than a
machine-gun (1640). In 1701 a Lorrainer, Beaufort de Mirecourt,
proposed a machine-gun which had as its purpose the
augmentation of infantry-fire power, so as to place an inferior
army on an equality with a superior. At this time inventors
were so numerous and so embarrassing that the French grand
master of artillery, St Hilaire, in 1703 wrote that he would be
glad to have done with &ldquo;ces sortes de gens à secrets,&rdquo; some of
whom demanded a grant of compensation even when their
experiments had failed. The machine-gun of the 17th and 18th
centuries in fact possessed no advantage over contemporary
field artillery, and the battalion gun in particular, which possessed
the long ranging and battering power that its rival lacked, and
was moreover more efficacious against living targets with its
case-shot or grape. As compared with infantry fire, too, it was
less effective and slower than the muskets of a well-drilled
company. Rapid fire was easily arranged, but the rapid
<i>loading</i> which would have compensated for other defects was
unobtainable in the then existing state of gun-making.</p>

<p>Thus a satisfactory machine-gun was not forthcoming until
breech-loading had been, so to speak, rediscovered, that is until
about 1860. At that time the tactical conditions of armament
were peculiar. As regards artillery, the new (muzzle-loading) long-range
rifle sufficed, in the hand of determined infantry, to keep
guns out of case-shot range. This made the Napoleonic artillery
attack an impossibility. At the same time the infantry rifle was
a slow loader, and the augmentation of the volume of infantry
fire attracted the attention of several inventors. The French,
with their artillery traditions, regarded the machine-gun therefore
as a method of restoring the lost superiority of the gunner,
while the Americans, equally in accordance with traditions and
local circumstances, regarded it as a musketry machine. The
representative weapons evolved by each were the <i>canon à balles</i>,
more commonly called <i>mitrailleuse</i>, and the Gatling gun.</p>

<p>The declared purpose of the <i>canon à balles</i> was to replace the
old artillery case-shot attack. Shrapnel, owing to the defects
of the time-fuzes then available, had proved disappointing in
the Italian War of 1859, and the gun itself, of the existing model,
was not considered satisfactory. Napoleon III., a keen student
of artillery, maintained a private arsenal and workshop at the
château of Meudon<a name="fa2u" id="fa2u" href="#ft2u"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and in 1866, in the alarm following upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span>
Königgrätz, he ordered Commandant Reffye (1821-1880), the
artillery officer he had placed in charge of it, to produce a
machine-gun. Reffye held that the work of a mitrailleuse should
only begin where that of the infantry rifle ceased. The handbook
to his gun issued to the French army in 1870 stated that it was
<span class="sidenote">The Canon à Balles, 1866-1870.</span>
&ldquo;to carry balls to distances that the infantry, and the
artillery firing case, could not reach.&rdquo; The most
suitable range was given as 1500-2000 yards against
infantry in close order, 2000-2700 against artillery.
As the French shrapnel (<i>obus à balles</i>) of these days was only
used to give its peculiar case-shot effect between 550 and 1350
yards, and even so sparingly and without much confidence in
its efficacy, it is clear that the <i>canon à balles</i> was intended to
do the field-gun&rsquo;s work, except at (what were then) extreme field
artillery ranges (2800 and above), in which case the ordinary
gun with common shell (time or percussion) alone was used.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Constructed to meet these conditions, the Reffye machine-gun
in its final form resembled outwardly an ordinary field gun, with
wheeled carriage, limber and four-horse team. The gun barrel
was in reality a casing for 25 rifle barrels disposed around a common
axis (the idea of obtaining sweeping effect by disposing the barrels
slightly fan-wise had been tried and abandoned). The barrels were
held together at intervals by wrought-iron plates. They were
entirely open at the breech, a removable false breech containing
the firing mechanism (the cartridge cases were of brass, solid-drawn,
like those of the American and unlike those of the British Gatlings).
This false breech, held in the firing position by a strong screw&mdash;resembling
roughly those of contemporary B.L. ordnance such as
the Armstrong R. B. L.&mdash;consisted of a plate with 25 holes, which
allowed the points of the strikers to pass through and reach the
cartridges. The plate was turned by hand so that one striker
was admitted at a time, the metal of the plate holding back the
rest. To avoid any deflection of the bullet by the gases at an adjoining
muzzle the barrels were fired in an irregular order. Each gun
was provided with four chambers, which were loaded with their 25
cartridges apiece by a charger, and fixed to the breech one after the
other as quickly as the manipulation of the powerful retaining screw
permitted. The rates of fire were &ldquo;slow,&rdquo; 3 rounds or 75 shots a
minute, and &ldquo;rapid,&rdquo; 5 rounds or 125 shots per minute. One advantage
as against artillery that was claimed for the new weapon was
rapidity of ranging. Any ordinary target, such as a hostile gun,
would, it was expected, be accurately ranged by the mitrailleuse before
it was ready to open fire for effect. The ordinary rifle bullet was
employed, but to enhance the case-shot effect a heavy bullet made up
in three parts, which broke asunder on discharge, was introduced in
1870 in the proportion of one round in nine. The weapon was sighted
to 3000 metres (3300 yds.). The initial velocity was 1558 f.s.;
and the weight of the gun 350 kg. (6.45 cwt.), of the carriage 371 kg.
(6.86 cwt.); total behind the team, 1,485 kg. (27.1 cwt.).</p>

<p>For an artillery effect, dispersion had to be combined with
accuracy. The rifle-barrels when carefully set gave a very close
grouping of shots on the target, and dispersion was obtained by
traversing the gun during the firing of a round. When this was
skilfully performed a front of 18 metres (about 20 yds.) at l,000
metres range was thoroughly swept by the cone of bullets.</p>
</div>

<p>The design and manufacture of these mitrailleuses under the
personal orders and at the expense of the emperor enabled the
French authorities to keep their new weapon most secret.
Even though, after a time, mitrailleuses were constructed by
scores, and could therefore no longer be charged to a &ldquo;sundry&rdquo;
or &ldquo;petty cash&rdquo; account in the budget, secrecy was still maintained.
The pieces were taken about, muffled in tarpaulins, by
by-ways and footpaths. In 1869, two years after the definitive
adoption of the weapon, only a few artillery captains were instructed
in its mechanism; the non-commissioned officers who
had to handle the gun in war were called up for practice in July
1870, when Major Reffye&rsquo;s energies were too much absorbed in
turning out the material so urgently demanded to allow him to
devote himself to their instruction. The natural consequence
was that the mitrailleuses were taken into battle by officers and
men of whom nine-tenths had never seen them fire one round
of live cartridges. The purpose of this fatal secrecy was the
maintenance of prestige. No details were given, but it was
confidently announced that war would be revolutionized. One
foreign officer only, Major Fosbery, R.A. (see <i>R.U.S.I. Journal</i>,
v. xiii.), penetrated the secret, and he felt himself bound in
honour to keep it to himself, not even communicating it to the
War Office. But public attention was only too fully aroused
by these mysterious prophecies. &ldquo;The mitrailleuse paid dearly
for its fame.&rdquo; The Prussians, who had examined mitrailleuses
of the Gatling or infantry type, were well aware that the artillery
machine-gun was at the least a most formidable opponent.
They therefore ostentatiously rejected the Gatling gun, taught
their troops that the new weapons were in the nature of scientific
toys, and secretly made up their minds to turn the whole weight
of their guns on to the mitrailleuse whenever and wherever it
appeared on the field, and so to overwhelm it at once. This
policy they carried into effect in the War of 1870; and although
on occasions the new weapon rendered excellent service, in
general it cruelly disappointed the over-high hopes of its
admirers. And thus, although the Gatling and similar types
of gun were employed to a slight extent by both sides in the
later stage of the war, machine-guns, as a class of armament for
civilized warfare, practically disappeared.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>As a good deal of criticism&mdash;after the event&mdash;has been levelled
at the French for their &ldquo;improper use of the machine-gun as a substitute
for artillery,&rdquo; it is necessary to give some summary of the
ideas and rules which were inspired by the inventor or dictated by
the authorities as to its tactical employment. The first principle
laid down was that the gun should not be employed within the zone
of the infantry fight. Officers commanding batteries were explicitly
warned against infantry divisional generals who would certainly
attempt to put the batteries, by sections, amongst the infantry.
The second principle was that the mitrailleuses were to share the
work of the guns, the latter battering obstacles with common shell,
and the former being employed against troops in the open, and
especially to cover and support the infantry advance. This tendency
to classify the rôles of the artillery and to tell off the batteries each
in its special task has reappeared in the French, and to a more limited
extent in the British, field artillery of to-day (the Germans alone
resolutely opposing the idea of subdivision). The mitrailleuse of
1870 was, in fact, intended to do what the perfected Shrapnel of
1910 does, to transfer the case-shot attack to longer ranges. But,
as we have seen, secrecy had prevented any general spread of knowledge
as to the uses to which the <i>canon à balles</i> was to be put, and
consequently, after a few weeks of the war, we find Reffye complaining
that the machine-guns were being used by their battery commanders
&ldquo;in a perfectly idiotic fashion. They are only good at a great
distance and when used in masses, and they are being employed at
close quarters like a rifle.&rdquo; The officers in the field, however, held
that it was foolish to pit the mitrailleuse against the gun, which had
a longer range, and exerted themselves to use it as an infantry
weapon, a concentrated company, for which, unlike the Gatlings of
1870 and the machine-guns of to-day, it was never designed. As
to which was right in the controversy it is impossible to dogmatize
and needless to argue.</p>
</div>

<p>Very different was the Gatling gun, the invention of Richard
Jordan Gatling (1818-1903), which came into existence and was
to a slight extent used in the field in the latter years of the
American Civil War,<a name="fa3u" id="fa3u" href="#ft3u"><span class="sp">3</span></a> and also to a still slighter extent by the
Bavarians and the French in the latter part of the war of 1870.
This was distinctively an infantry type weapon, a sort of revolving
rifle, the ten barrels of which were set around an axis,
<span class="sidenote">Gatling Gun.</span>
and fired in turn when brought into position by
the revolving mechanism. This weapon had a long
reign, and was used side by side with the latest automatic
machine gun in the Spanish-American War of 1898. The following
account of the old British service Gatling (fig. 1), as used in
the Egyptian and Sudanese campaigns, is condensed from that
in the article &ldquo;Gun-making,&rdquo; <i>Ency. Brit.</i> 9th ed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A block of ten barrels is secured round an axis, which is fixed in a
frame <i>a a</i>. On turning the handle <i>h</i> (fig. 2) the spindle <i>g g</i> causes
the worm <i>f</i> to act on the pinion <i>w</i>, making the axis and barrels
revolve. A drum T (figs. 1 and 4) is placed on the top at the breech
end of the barrels over a hopper, through a slot in which the cartridges
drop into the carrier (fig. 3). The construction of the lock is
shown in fig. 4. A A A A is a cam, sloping as in the drawing, which,
it must be understood, represents the circular construction opened
out and laid flat. As the barrels, carrier and locks revolve the slope
of the cam forces the locks forward and backward alternately.
At position I. the cartridge has just fallen into the carrier, the lock
and bolt are completely withdrawn. At positions II., III., IV.,
the cam is forcing them forward, so that the bolt pushes the cartridge
into the barrel. At IV. the cocking cam R begins to compress
the spiral spring, releasing it at V. Position VI. shows the cartridge
just after firing; the extractor is clutching the base of the cartridge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span>
case, which is withdrawn as the locks retreat down the slope of the
cam, till at X it falls through an aperture to the ground. The drum
consists of a number of vertical channels radiating from the centre.
The cartridges are arranged horizontally, one above the other, in
these channels, bullet ends inwards. The drum revolves on the pivot
<i>b</i> (fig. 3). and the cartridges fall through the aperture B. When all
the channels are emptied, a full drum is brought from the limber,
and substituted for the empty one. Each barrel fires in turn
as it comes to a certain position, so that by turning the handle
quickly an almost continuous stream of bullets can be ejected.
Experimental Gatlings were constructed which could be made to fire
nearly 1000 shots a minute, and an automatic traversing arrangement
was also fitted.</p>

<p>As has been said, this weapon had a long reign. It was used
with great effect in the Zulu War at Ulundi and in the Sudan.
But a grave disadvantage of the English pattern was that it
had to be used with the Boxer coiled cartridge supplied for the
Martini-Henry rifle, and until this was replaced by a solid-drawn
cartridge case it was impossible to avoid frequent &ldquo;jams.&rdquo;
The modern, fully automatic, machine gun suffers from this
to a considerable extent, and it was an even more serious defect
with a hand-operated weapon, as the British troops found in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>
their campaigns against the Mahdists. But the Gatling had
many advantages over its newer rivals as regards simplicity
and strength. Theodore Roosevelt, who commanded sections of
both types in the Spanish-American War, speaks with enthusiasm
of the old-fashioned weapon<a name="fa4u" id="fa4u" href="#ft4u"><span class="sp">4</span></a> while somewhat disparaging the
Colt automatic.</p>

<p class="pt2">The Gardner was another type which had a certain vogue<a name="fa5u" id="fa5u" href="#ft5u"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
and was used by the British in savage warfare. But, next to
the Gatling, the most important of the hand-operated machine
guns was the Nordenfeldt, which was principally designed for
naval use about the time when torpedo-boats were beginning
to be regarded as dangerous antagonists.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In this weapon the barrels are placed horizontally, and have no
movement. A box containing the locks, bolts, strikers and spiral
springs, one of each corresponding to each barrel, moves
<span class="sidenote">Nordenfeldt Gun.</span>
straight backwards and forwards when worked by the
handle of the lever on the right. When the box is
drawn back the cartridges fall from the holder on the top into the
carriers simultaneously. When the box is pushed forward the bolts
push the cartridges into the barrel, cocking-catches compress the
spiral springs, the lever releases the catches one after the other at
very minute intervals of time, and the cartridges are fired in rapid
succession. In this piece, careful aim can be taken from a moving
platform, and at the right moment the barrels can be fired at the
object almost simultaneously.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">Present Day Machine-guns.</span></p>

<p>Hitherto we have been dealing with weapons worked by hand-power
applied to a lever or winch-handle, the motion of this
lever being translated by suitable mechanism into those by which
the cartridges are loaded, fired, extracted and ejected&mdash;the cycle
continuing as long as the lever is worked and there are cartridges
in the &ldquo;hoppers&rdquo; which feed the gun. In the modern &ldquo;automatic&rdquo;
machine-gun, moreover, the loading, firing, extracting
and ejecting are all performed automatically by the gun itself,
either by the recoil of its barrel, or by a small portion of the
gases of explosion being allowed to escape through a minute
hole in the barrel near the muzzle. The following details of
the British Maxim, Hotchkiss and Colt types are reproduced
from the article &ldquo;Machine-guns,&rdquo; <i>Ency. Brit.</i> 10th ed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span></p>

<p>The idea of using the recoil, or a portion of the gases of explosion,
for the working of the breech mechanism is by no means
new, the latter system having been proposed and patented
(certainly in a very crude and probably unworkable form) by
(Sir) Henry Bessemer in 1854; but whatever might be discovered
by a search in old patent and other records or in
museums, there can be no doubt that (Sir) Hiram S. Maxim was
the first to produce a finished automatic gun of practical value.
His patents in connexion with this particular class of weapon
date back to 1884, and his gun on the recoil system was, after
extensive trials, adopted into the British army in 1889 and into
the navy in 1892. It is very possible that Bessemer&rsquo;s idea did
not bear fruit earlier because the fouling left by the old forms of
&ldquo;black&rdquo; or smoky powders was apt to clog the moving parts
and to choke any small port. With modern smokeless powders
this difficulty does not arise.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Maxim gun,<a name="fa6u" id="fa6u" href="#ft6u"><span class="sp">6</span></a> as will be seen from figs. 7 and 8, consists of two
parts, the barrel casing (<i>a</i>) and breech casing (<i>d</i>), secured firmly
together. The former (<i>a</i>), which is cylindrical in form,
contains the barrel (<i>b</i>), and the water surrounding it
<span class="sidenote">Maxim Gun.</span>
to keep down the very high temperature attained by
rapid fire, and the steam tube (<i>c</i>), which by the action of a sliding
valve allows of the escape of steam but not of water. The barrel has
asbestos packings at its front and rear bearings in the casing, which
allow of its sliding in recoil without the escape of water. The breech
casing (<i>d</i>) is a rectangular oblong box, and contains the lock and
firing mechanism. At its rear end it has handles (<i>e</i>) by which the
gun is directed, and the thumb-piece (<i>m</i>) by which the trigger is
actuated. Its top is closed by a lid, hinged at (<i>i</i>). At its front
is a recess holding the feed-block (<i>f</i>) through which the belt of
cartridges (<i>g</i>) is fed to the gun.</p>

<p>Attached to the rear of the barrel (<i>b</i>) on either side are two side
plates (<i>h</i>), between which in guides O works the aggregation of parts
D, F, J, K, L, P, T and V, which constitute the lock, and (in bearings)
the crank axle E, crank E&prime;, and connecting rod I (see figs. 7 to 11).</p>

<p>The connecting rod I joins the lock and crank, being attached
to the side levers J of the former by means of the
interrupted screw U; the latter enables the lock to
be detached and removed.</p>

<p>The crank axle E extends through both sides
of the breech casing (<i>d</i>), slots (<i>k</i>, fig. 7), allowing
it a longitudinal movement of about an inch.
To its left-hand end, outside the breech casing,
is attached the fusee chain Y of the recoil spring
X (see dotted lines in fig. 7), and to its right-hand
end a bell trunk lever, B B&prime;; the arm B,
which terminates in a knob, being turned by the
crank handle, the arm B&prime; working against the
buffer stop C.</p>

<p>In figs. 8, 9 and 11 the breech is shown closed,
and it will be noticed that the crank pin I&rsquo; is
<i>above</i> the straight line joining the axis of the
barrel, the striker T, and the crank axle E. As
the crank is prevented from further movement
<i>upwards</i> by the crank handle B taking against
the check-lever G (fig. 7), it is clear that the
pressure on discharge of the cartridge cannot
cause the crank axle to rotate, and so open the
breech as shown in figs. 10 and 12.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of the lock and opening of the breech are effected
as follows: The <i>total</i> travel in recoil of the barrel is about one inch,
but on discharge the barrel, the side plates and lock all recoil
<i>together</i> for about a quarter of an inch without any disturbance
of the locking as explained above, and by the time this short travel
is completed the <i>bullet has left the muzzle</i>. The arm B&prime; of the crank
handle then engages the buffer stop C and causes the crank axle E
to rotate and the crank E&prime; to fall and so draw back the lock from,
and open, the breech. At the same time the fusee chain Y is wound
up round the left-hand end of the crank axle E and the spring X
extended. In the meantime the knob of the buffer handle B swings
over, and just as the lock reaches its rearmost position (as in figs.
10 and 12) strikes the flat buffer spring H, and, rebounding, assists
the crank in revolving in the reverse direction; the spring X also
contracts, and, unwinding the fusee chain, draws back the lock
again and closes the breech, a fresh cartridge having been placed
in the barrel as explained below.</p>

<p>The gun is fired by means of the trigger F, which is actuated by
the projection (<i>l</i>) on the trigger bar (S), the latter being drawn back
when the button (<i>m</i>) on the push lever (<i>n</i>) is pressed forwards.
If, therefore, the button he kept permanently pressed, the projection
(<i>l</i>) will always lie in the path of the trigger F just as the lock reaches
its forward position and the breech is closed, and the gun will fire
automatically, and continue to do so as long as there are cartridges
in the belt.</p>

<p>The loading, extraction and ejection of the cartridges are effected
as follows: The left-hand side-plate is extended forwards a little
beyond the breech, and communicates the reciprocating motion of
the barrel to a lever on the feed-block, which causes the cartridges
in the belt to be fed forward one by one by a &ldquo;step-by-step&rdquo; pawl
action, the cartridge which is next to be taken from the belt being
arrested exactly above the breech, the ejector-tube Q being below
in the same vertical plane.</p>

<p>The extractor D (see figs. 9 to 12) which performs the operations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span>
of inserting, extracting and ejecting the cartridges, travels vertically
in guides on the face of the lock. Projecting outwards from each
side of its top are horns N (figs. 9 and 10). These travel round the
edges of the cams M (fig. 8) situated on each side of the breech casing,
and in conjunction with the spring W (fig. 8), compel the top of the
extractor to take the path shown by the dotted lines and arrows in
figs. 9 to 12.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:677px; height:272px" src="images/img243a.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 9.</span>&mdash;Maxim Gun Mechanism.</td></tr></table>

<p>The extractor (figs. 11 and 12) is recessed to take a movable
plate (<i>u</i>) termed a &ldquo;gib,&rdquo; behind which is a spring (<i>v</i>). In the face
of the gib is a recess (<i>w</i>) into which the base of a cartridge can just
enter. On either side of the gib the face of the extractor has undercut
flanges, open at the top and bottom, between which the base of
a cartridge can fit the rim, being held in the undercuts (figs. 9 and 10).</p>

<p>It is clear from this arrangement that the base of the cartridge
having been introduced between the flanges at the top of the
extractor, can be pushed down, the spring (<i>v</i>) yielding, till arrested
at the recess (<i>w</i>); and, as the lower edges of this
recess are slightly sloped, further pressure will
make it leave the recess (<i>w</i>) and slide over the
face of the gib, leave it, and take up a position
in front of the hole for the point of the striker
(<i>x</i>), being now only prevented from slipping out
of the extractor by the extractor spring (<i>y</i>). If
this last be clear of the extractor stop (<i>z</i>) it will
yield to pressure and the cartridge will be free.
This is the action in the gun except that the
cartridge is held firm and the extractor pushed
against it.</p>

<p>In fig. 10 the extractor holds a cartridge (<i>r</i>) and
a fired case (<i>q</i>) ready to be pushed into the empty
breech and ejector-tube Q respectively. In the
latter there is already a fired case (<i>p</i>), which will
be driven by the fired case (<i>q</i>) beyond the ejector
spring R. As soon as the lock reaches the face of
the breech, the cartridge (<i>r</i>) and case (<i>q</i>) are
deposited in the breech and ejector-tube respectively,
and the extractor D <i>rises</i> under the action of the levers L and J,
slides, as already explained, by the bases of the cartridges (<i>r</i>) and
case (<i>q</i>), and then over the base of the cartridge (<i>s</i>) in the belt (<i>g</i>).
Assuming the push-lever (<i>n</i>) to be pressed, the gun fires immediately
this has occurred, and the bullet of the cartridge (<i>r</i>) is expelled. The
position is now that shown in fig. 9. The barrel now recoils and the
lock is withdrawn, taking with it the fresh cartridge (<i>s</i>) from the belt
and the now fired case (<i>r</i>). The extractor travels horizontally for
a time and then drops (as shown by the dotted line and arrows),
assuming the position shown in fig. 12, which is exactly similar to
that in fig. 10 but with different cartridges; continuing the action,
the position shown in fig. 11 is arrived at. It will thus be seen that
each cartridge makes two complete journeys with the extractor;
the first as a live cartridge from the belt to the breech, the
second from the breech to the ejector-tube, the forward journey
being always on a lower level than that of the backward one. The
sections in figs. 11 and 12 clearly show the cocking and firing
mechanism and the safety arrangement. The lock is cocked, after
firing, by the arm of the &ldquo;tumbler&rdquo; K, being pressed down by the
side lever J as it swings down when following the crank E&rsquo;. Safety
against firing before the breech is closed is provided by the projection
on the safety lever V, which does not clear the striker T until lifted
by the side lever J at the top of its travel, that is, when the crank E&rsquo;
has passed the axial line as already explained.</p>

<p>The lock in its rearmost position is kept in
place by the block Z on the under side of the
cover of the breech casing. When in this position
it is clear of the guides O on the side-plates, and
if the cover be opened it can be turned up, unscrewed
by a turn through an eighth of a circle
(the screw-thread U being interrupted in four
places) and removed. To prepare the gun for
firing, the crank handle is pushed over by hand
to the buffer-spring, thus withdrawing the extractor,
and held in this position; the tongue on
the end of a filled belt is then pushed through the
feed-block from the left and pulled as far as it
will go from the opposite side. This places a
cartridge above the breech ready to be seized by
the extractor. The crank handle is now released
and the lock flies forwards. The crank handle is
now again pushed over and let go, and the first
cartridge thus taken from the belt and placed in
the breech. The gun is ready to fire.</p>

<p>To remove a partially filled belt, the crank handle must be pushed
over, thus freeing the extractor from the belt, and the latter withdrawn
after pressing a spring catch under the feed block which
releases the pawls. The gun now has <i>two</i> live cartridges in it&mdash;both
in the extractor. Letting go the crank handle, one of them is
deposited in the ejector-tube, and again pushing over and letting
go the crank handle does the same with the second.</p>

<p>Fig. 13 shows the feed-block and the cartridge belts. The greatest
number usually carried in a belt is 250.</p>

<p>The gun is sighted to 2,500 yds. and has a folding tangent sight as
shown. Its weight varies from 50 to 60 &#8468;, and it can fire about
450 rounds per minute.</p>

<p>[The diagrams have been made from drawings, by permission of
Messrs. Vickers, Sons &amp; Maxim.]</p>

<p>The Hotchkiss gun, figs. 14 to 16, which has been adopted by
the French army and navy and elsewhere, depends for its action
on the use of a small portion of the gases of the cartridge itself.
The barrel A is firmly attached to the receiver or frame B, the latter
<span class="sidenote">Hotchkiss Gun.</span>
containing the breech and firing mechanism. Under
the barrel A, and communicating with it by a port (<i>c</i>)
near the muzzle is a cylinder or tube C.
When the gun is fired, and the bullet has passed
the port (<i>c</i>), a portion of the gases of explosion
passes into the cylinder C and drives back the
piston F contained in it, a lug on the under part
of the piston compressing the spring M, the
latter, when the trigger N is pulled, driving back
the piston again. The reciprocating motion of
the piston performs all the processes of loading
and firing the gun, and the action is continuous
as long as the trigger is kept pressed back.</p>

<p>The piston F, enlarged and suitably shaped at
the rear, actuates the breech-block H and firing
pin or striker J; and, by suitable cam grooves
(<i>f</i>) at about the centre of its length, works the
larger feed-wheel U of the feed-box S; the smaller
wheel U on the same axis in turn imparting a
step-by-step motion to the metal feed-strips, each
containing 30 cartridges, so that fresh cartridges are placed one
by one before the face of the breech block ready to be pushed
into the breech when the fired cartridge has been extracted and
ejected.</p>

<p>On the under surface of the piston F, in rear, is a recess or sear
(<i>f</i>) in which the nose of the trigger N engages, holding back the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span>
piston when it has been driven back by the gases. As already
stated, a lug on the under surface just in rear of the cam (<i>f</i>) engages
with the front of the mainspring.</p>

<p>Taking first the position shown in fig. 15 with the breech closed
and locked and the cartridge fired, it will be seen that the breech
is locked by the <i>upper</i> cam (<i>f</i>&prime;), on
the end of the piston, F, having
caused the movable locking-dog (<i>h</i>)
to fall and bear against the recoil
blocks Z (see fig. 14 also) on the walls
of the <i>receiver</i> or frame B. Consequently
the breech is not unlocked
until the piston has moved sufficiently
to the rear for the <i>lower</i> cam (<i>f</i>&prime;) to
lift the locking-dog (<i>h</i>) clear of the
recoil blocks Z. As the piston F
is not actuated by the gases until
the bullet has passed the port (<i>c</i>),
and then has to move a short distance
before the locking-dog is
raised, the bullet is clear of the
muzzle <i>before</i> the breech is unlocked.</p>

<p>As the piston continues to recoil
it draws back the striker J and then
the breech-block H, and is then
caught and retained by the engagement
of the sear (<i>f</i>) with the trigger N, and the position assumed
is that shown in fig. 14.</p>

<p>From the head or nose-piece I of the breech-block projects the
claw K of a spring extractor which, as the cartridge is pushed home
by the breech-block, seizes it, extracting the fired case when the
breech-block is withdrawn. Ejection of the fired case is effected
by means of the ejector L (fig. 16) which catches against the base of
the case, on the opposite side to the extractor claw, and so throws
it sideways through the oblong-pointed opening in the receiver just
in rear of the breech (see fig. 14).</p>

<p>The platform on the top of the feed-box through which the teeth
of the smaller feed-wheel U project, and on which the feed-strips
rest, lies <i>below</i> the axial line of the breech-block H, so that the face
or nose-piece I of the latter only engages a <i>portion</i> of the base of the
cartridge in the feed-strip as it pushes the cartridge into the breech,
the bullet of the cartridge being guided into the breech by the incline
at the opening of the latter.  This point should be specially noted,
the object of the arrangement being to enable the under surface of
the breech-block to clear the clips which hold the cartridges in the
feed-strips. The cartridge therefore, being extracted in the line of
the axis of the block, is ejected through an opening
<i>above</i> its plane of entry in the feed-strip.</p>

<p>Returning to the position shown in fig. 16, if the
trigger be pulled, the compressed spring M reacts
and drives the piston forwards, carrying the breech-block
with it, the latter in turn driving a cartridge
in front of it out of the feed-strip. When the block
and cartridge are home, <i>and not till then</i>, the piston
completes its travel, the upper cam (<i>f</i>&prime;) locking the
dog (<i>h</i>), and the firing-pin protrudes and fires the
cartridge. Anything, therefore, which prevents the
breech-block from being home against the breech,
or the locking-dog from falling in front of the recoil
blocks Z, renders firing of the cartridge impossible.
Clearly if the trigger be kept depressed the action
becomes automatic.</p>

<p>A special feature of this gun is the absence of a
separate spring to actuate the firing-pin; the recoil
spring M performing this function, in addition to
that of driving the piston forwards.</p>

<p>The feed-strips have holes in them in which the teeth of the smaller
feed-wheel U engage. The engagement of this feed with the piston
F can be released by pulling out the feed arbor W, so that the strips
can be removed at any time.</p>

<p>When the last shot in a feed-strip has been fired a stop (V) holds
the piston and block ready for a fresh feed-strip to be inserted.
As the stop V acts quite independently of the trigger, this action
takes place even if the trigger be still depressed after the last cartridge
in a strip has been fired.</p>

<p>To cock the gun, when in the locked position, a cocking handle G
is provided. This has a long arm projecting to the front with a
catch which takes against the front of the lug on the under side of
the piston. To prepare the gun for action the gun is cocked, and a
feed-strip is pushed into the feed-block.</p>

<p>The pressure of the gas on the piston is regulated by the regulator
screw D, by means of which the space in the cylinder C in front of
the piston F can be reduced or increased.</p>

<p>A safety lock R is furnished, which is a &ldquo;half round&rdquo; pin
which can be turned so as to enter the semicircular slot just in
front of the sear (<i>f</i>), and so hold back the piston when in the cocked
position.</p>

<p>Radiation of the heat, generated in the barrel by rapid fire, is
facilitated by the radiator (<i>a</i>), which consists of rings on the barrel
close to the breech, which offer an increased surface to the air.</p>

<p>The gun is sighted to 2000 yds., with the ordinary flap back-sight,
weighs about 53 &#8468;, and can fire from 500 to 600 rounds per
minute.</p>

<p>The Colt automatic gun, which has been adopted by the American
army and navy, and was used by the British in S. Africa, depends
for its action, similarly to the Hotchkiss, on the escape
of a small portion of the gases of explosion through a
<span class="sidenote">Colt Gun.</span>
port in the barrel a short distance from the muzzle. Figs. 17 and
18 give a plan, and side elevation with the left side plate removed,
respectively. Into the recess in the barrel (92) just below the
port fits the piston (35), capable of slight motion round the pivot
(36), by which it is attached to the gas lever (29). The latter
is a bell-crank lever pivoted at (34), its short arm being attached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
at (46) by a pivot to a long link with a cross head, termed the
retracting connexion (45). This link extends from a point close to
the figures (44), where the arms of the cross head bear against the
ends of two long spiral retracting springs, (37) and (38), contained
in two tubes, (39) and (40), which are slotted for a few inches of
their length to allow the cross head to follow up and compress the
springs. (Only (38) and (40) are shown, (37) and (39) lying in the
same plane of projection.)</p>

<p>When the gun fires, and the bullet has passed the port, the gases
drive the piston (35) and gas lever (29) downwards, and the momentum
imparted causes them to swing back round the pivot (36), as
shown by the dotted circle. The gas lever is brought up now by the
bottom plate (91); and the retracting springs, compressed by the
cross head of the long link (45) owing to the <i>forward</i> motion of the
short arm of the gas lever, react and drive the gas lever into its
forward position again.</p>

<p>The rotary movement of the gas lever is converted into a reciprocating
movement of the slide (86) by means of the gas lever connexion
rod (31) pivoted at (32) to the gas lever, and at (87) to the slide.</p>

<p>The slide (86) is a nearly flat bar, travelling in guides in the receiver,
extending from (14) to (87). It is slotted completely through
longitudinally for nearly the whole of its length, this slot affording
an opening through which work the cartridge extractor (82) and
carrier (21). At its rear end it engages by means of a pin (14) in a
cam slot (97) in the bottom rib of the bolt (13), and at (83) it bears
the pivot of the cartridge extractor (82). Its rear end is enlarged
below to form a cam lug (98), and on its right side are two projections
(95) and (96), which work the feed lever (66).</p>

<p>The feed wheel (61), over which passes the belt containing the
cartridges, is actuated by a pawl &ldquo;step-by-step&rdquo; gear by means of
the feed lever (66).</p>

<p>The carrier (21) is a long trip lever pivoted at (22), and provided
with a spring dog (23) pivoted at (24).</p>

<p>The bolt (13) is a cylinder with a guide rib extending from its
under surface. It is actuated by the slide by means of the pin
(14) and cam slot (97) as already stated, and is bored through to
take the striker or firing pin (18). The rear end of the latter projects
slightly beyond the rear face of the bolt, being retained in this
position by the spring (19). When this projecting end is pushed
into the bolt, the point protrudes from the front of the bolt and fires
the cartridge. The bolt, when the breech is locked, is held firm by
two recoil blocks on the receiver (not shown), as is explained later.
At the front of the bolt is an extractor (15) with a spring claw for
extracting the fired case. (This is of course quite distinct from the
cartridge extractor (82).) Ejection is effected by means of an ejector
projecting into the path of the fired case.</p>

<p>The firing of the gun is performed by the cylindrical hammer
(6) hollowed out in rear to contain the mainspring (7). When
pushed back and cocked as shown in fig. 18, it is held during a <i>portion</i>
of the operations of the mechanism by two detents working independently
of each other&mdash;the sear (10) and the nose of the trigger (8).
The former is automatically released by a trip lever (not shown) as
soon as the breech is locked, leaving the hammer held by the trigger
only. This is the position shown in fig. 18. The necessity for the
two detents is explained later.</p>

<p>The hammer, when cocked, can also be permanently locked by
the handle lock (2) actuated by a thumb-piece on the outside of the
receiver. The air compressed in rear of the hammer, as the latter
is driven back, passes through the tube (99) to the breech; and a
puff of air is therefore blown through the barrel after every shot,
clearing out fouling and unconsumed powder, and assisting to an
appreciable extent to keep down the temperature of the barrel.</p>

<p>Taking the position shown in fig. 18, the hammer is only held
back by the trigger nose, the sear (10) having been released as stated
above. A belt of cartridges (not shown) has been placed on the feed-wheel,
and the cartridge next to be used after the one (not shown)
now in the breech has its rim (or base with rimless cartridges) just
above the hook on the extractor (82). If now the trigger be pulled,
the hammer flies forwards, strikes the protruding end of the firing
pin, and the cartridge fires; the gases cause the gas lever to swing
round and drive back the slide. The pin (14) working in the cam
groove (97) causes the rear of the bolt to <i>rise</i> and clear itself from the
recoil blocks (not shown) on the receiver, and then to move rearwards
horizontally, driving the hammer back until the latter is caught
and held by the sear and trigger. In the meantime the extractor
(82) has pulled a cartridge from the belt, and, assisted by two spring
cartridge guides (80 and 81), of which only (80) is shown, deposits
it on the carrier (21); the projection (95) strikes the feed-lever (66),
and moves the feed mechanism so as to prepare to revolve the feed-wheel
and place a fresh cartridge ready for the next round; and as
the slide completes its travel backwards, the cam (98) strikes the
dog (23) and slightly depresses it (the spring (25) yielding), the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span>
carrier and cartridge on it consequently rising a little and falling again
(this latter action is incidental only to the form of the parts, and is
not a necessity).</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:445px; height:642px" src="images/img246a.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 20.&mdash;Hotchkiss Gun mounted.</td></tr></table>

<p>The retracting springs now react and pull the slide forwards;
the cam (98) strikes the dog (23), which, as the spring arrangement
is of the &ldquo;non-return&rdquo; class, does not yield but is depressed, and the
front of the carrier and the cartridge on it are therefore raised sharply,
and the latter placed in the path of the bolt. The bolt being now
pulled forwards, the cartridge is driven off the carrier into the breech,
and the bolt locked by the pin (14), causing the bolt to drop in front
of the recoil blocks; the carrier is pushed down flat by the advance
of the cam lug (98), the trip releases the sear (10), and the projection
(96) pushes back the feed lever, completing the action of feeding a
fresh cartridge forward. The position shown in fig. 17 is now
resumed.</p>

<p>It is clear that were the trigger kept permanently pulled the
gun would fire immediately the bolt was locked and the sear (10)
depressed, and the action would become automatic.</p>

<p>The object of two detents, though now probably obvious, may here
be explained. The whole action of the gun depends upon the hammer
after it is pushed back by the bolt being <i>held</i> back until the bolt
has gone completely forwards and locked the breech. If only the
trigger detent existed, and that were kept pressed down, the hammer,
after being pushed back by the bolt, would immediately <i>follow up</i>
the latter, and might fire the cartridge prematurely, or fail to fire it
at all; hence the use of the sear in addition to the trigger.</p>

<p>To cock the lock, or work the mechanism by hand, the gas lever
is pulled round by the pin (30) provided for the purpose, and by this
means the gun is prepared for firing. A brass tongue on the end of
the belt is pushed through the opening above the feed-wheel and then
pulled from the other side of the gun as far as it will go. This
places a cartridge in front of the extractor, and if the gas lever be
now pulled right back and let go, this cartridge is placed in the
breech as already described, and the gun is ready for firing. If it
be desired to remove a belt from the feed, a button (68) is pressed and
the feed-wheel is then free to revolve backwards.</p>

<p>The gun is sighted with the ordinary rifle-pattern sights, up to
2000 yds. or more if required. It weighs about 40 &#8468;, and can fire
about 400 rounds per minute as usually adjusted, though this rate
can be increased. There is no means of altering the gas pressure
in the field as with the Hotchkiss.</p>

<p>[The diagrams have been made from drawings, by permission of
the Colt Arms Company.]</p>
</div>

<p>Comparing the principle of employing a recoiling barrel with
that of using a portion of the gas, the advantages of the former
are that the recoil is made to do useful work instead of straining
the gun and mounting in its absorption; the latter system,
however, has undoubtedly the advantage in simplicity of mechanism
(the Hotchkiss is extraordinarily simple in construction
for an automatic gun), and in the large margin of power for
working the mechanism with certainty in all conditions of
exposure to climate, dust, and dirt. While inferior in this
respect, it is nevertheless the fact that the Maxim has proved
itself in the field even in savage warfare in the roughest country
to be a very efficient and powerful weapon.</p>

<p>The great difficulty which has to be met in all single-barrel
machine guns is the heating of the barrel. The 7½ pints of
water in the water-jacket of the Maxim gun are raised to boiling
point by 600 rounds of rapid fire&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> in about 1½ minutes&mdash;and
if firing be continued, about 1½ pints of water are evaporated
for every 1000 rounds. Assuming that the operation is continuous,
the rate of waste of energy due to heat expended on the
water <i>alone</i> is equivalent to about 20 horse-power (294 foot
tons per minute). The water-jacket acts well in keeping down
the temperature of the barrel; but apart from the complications
entailed by its use, the provision of water for this purpose is at
times exceedingly troublesome on service. In the Hotchkiss and
Colt guns, which have no water-jacket, an attempt is made to
meet the heating, in the one by the radiator, and in the other
by a very heavy barrel.</p>

<p>One of the most modern types of gun is the Schwarzlose,
which is manufactured at Steyr in Austria, and was adopted by
the Austrian army in 1907. This weapon is remarkable for its
simplicity. There are only 10 main working parts, and any of
these can be replaced in a few seconds. It is operated by the
gases of the explosion, has a water-jacket that allows 3000
rounds to be fired without refilling. The &ldquo;life&rdquo; of the gun-barrel
is stated to be 35,000 rounds without serious loss of
accuracy. The weight of the gun is 37.9 &#8468;. It is a belt loader.</p>

<p>The Italian Perino gun, adopted in 1907, is a recoil-operated
weapon, and is loaded by a metal clip. The Skoda gun, some
of which type are used in Japan and China, is loaded by a
hopper feed, and is gas-operated. The Bergmann gun is a
belt loader, but the belt passes down a &ldquo;gravity feed&rdquo; an
arrangement which saves a number of working parts.</p>

<p>One defect common to all is that it is by no means easy to
proportion the fire to the target, as there are only two rates
of fire, viz. rapid automatic and slow single shots. To fire a
single shot requires practice, since the gun will fire some 7 shots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span>
in one <i>second</i>, and to press the trigger and remove the finger or
thumb instantly, and at the same time be ready to traverse
to a fresh target, requires considerable skill. The result of these
difficulties is that the target when struck is often riddled with
bullets when one would have sufficed. The aiming of the gun,
when rapid fire is taking place, may also be difficult even on
firmly fixed mountings, owing to vibration. The greater
delicacy of the modern machine gun has been alluded to above.<a name="fa7u" id="fa7u" href="#ft7u"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
Nevertheless the advantages of safety, steadiness and lightness
which the automatic weapon possesses, have ensured its victory
over the older type of weapon, and although the simple strong
and well-tried Gatling still has its advocates, every civilized
army has adopted one or more of the automatic types.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">Organization and Tactical Employment</span><a name="fa8u" id="fa8u" href="#ft8u"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p>Although machine-gun tactics are still somewhat indefinite, at
least there are well-marked tendencies which have a close relation
to the general tactical scheme or doctrine adopted by each of
the various armies as suited to its own purposes and conditions.
For many years before the South African and Manchurian
wars, the machine-gun had been freely spoken of as &ldquo;a
diabolical weapon before which nothing could live,&rdquo; but this
did not contribute much to the science of handling it. Most
military powers, indeed, distrusted it&mdash;actuated perhaps by the
remembrance of the vain hopes excited by the <i>canon à balles</i>.
It was not until the second half of the war of 1904-05 that the
Japanese, taught by the effective handling of the Russian
machine-guns at Liao-Yang, introduced it into their field armies,
and although Great Britain had provided every regular battalion
with a Maxim-gun section some years before the Boer War, and a
Volunteer corps, the Central London Rangers (now 12th bn.
London Regiment) had maintained a (Nordenfeldt) gun section
since 1882, instruction in the tactics of the weapon was confined
practically to the simple phrase &ldquo;the machine-gun is a weapon
of opportunity.&rdquo; More than this, at any rate, is attempted
in the drill-books of to-day.</p>

<p>One important point is that, whether the guns are used as an
arm, in numbers, or as auxiliaries, in sections, they should be
free to move without having to maintain their exact position
relatively to some other unit. It was in following the infantry
firing lines of their own battalion over the open that the British
Maxims suffered most heavily in South Africa. Another of
equal importance is that the machine guns must co-operate
with other troops of their side in the closest possible way; more,
in this regard, is demanded of them than of artillery, owing to
their mobility and the relative ease of obtaining cover. A
third factor, which has been the subject of numerous experiments,
is the precise value of a machine-gun, stated in terms of
infantry, <i>i.e.</i> how many rifles would be required to produce
the fire-effect of a machine-gun. A fourth&mdash;and on this the
teaching of military history is quite definite&mdash;is the need of
concealment and of evading the enemy&rsquo;s shrapnel. These points,
once the datum of efficiency of fire has been settled, resolve
themselves into two conclusions&mdash;the necessity for combining
independence and co-operation, and the desirability of Mercury&rsquo;s
winged feet and cap of darkness for the weapon itself. It is on
the former that opinions in Europe vary most. Some armies
ensure co-operation by making the machine-gun section an
integral part of the infantry regimental organization, but in
this case the officer commanding it must be taught and allowed
to shake himself free from his comrades and immediate superiors
when necessary. Others ensure co-operation of the machine-guns
as an arm by using them, absolutely free of infantry
control, on batteries; but this brings them face to face with the
risks of showing, not one or two low-lying gun-barrels, but a
number of carriages, limbers and gun teams, within range of
the enemy&rsquo;s artillery.</p>

<p>French experiments are said to show that the fire-power
of a machine-gun is equal to that of 150-200 rifles at exactly
known range, and to 60-80 rifles at ranges judged by the French
&ldquo;instantaneous range-finder.&rdquo; The German drill-book gives
it as equal approximately to that of 80 rifles on an average.
The distinction of known and unknown ranges is due to the
fact that the &ldquo;cone of dispersion&rdquo; of a large number of bullets
in collective infantry fire is deeper than that of machine-gun
fire. The latter therefore groups its bullets much more closely
<span class="sidenote">Fire Effect.</span>
about the target if the latter is in the centre of the
cone&mdash;viz. at known ranges&mdash;but if the distance
be misjudged not only the close central group of
50% of the shots, but even the outlying rounds may fall
well away from the target. At 1500 yards range the &ldquo;50
per cent. zone&rdquo; with the Maxim gun is only 34 yards deep as
compared with the 60 yards of a half-company of rifles.<a name="fa9u" id="fa9u" href="#ft9u"><span class="sp">9</span></a> The
accuracy of the gun is more marked when the breadth of the
cone of dispersion is taken into account. The &ldquo;75 per cent.&rdquo;
zone is in the case of the machine-gun about as broad at 2000
yards as that of collective rifle fire at 500. At the School of
Musketry, South Africa, a trial between 42 picked marksmen and
a Maxim at an unknown range at service targets resulted in
408 rounds from the rifles inflicting a loss of 54% on the
enemy&rsquo;s firing line represented by the targets, and 228 rounds
from the Maxim inflicting one of 64%. Another factor is
rapidity of fire. It is doubtful if infantry can keep up a rate of
12 rounds a minute for more than two or three minutes at a
time without exhaustion and consequent wild shooting. The
machine-gun, with all its limitations in this respect, can probably,
taking a period of twenty or thirty minutes, deliver a greater
<span class="sidenote">Ranging.</span>
volume of fire than fifty rifles, and assuming that,
by one device or another (ranging by observing the
strike of the bullets, the use of a telemeter, or the employment
of &ldquo;combined sights&rdquo;) the 75% cone of bullets has been
brought on to the target, that fire will be more effective. The
serious limiting condition is the need of accurate ranging. If
this is unsatisfactory the whole (and not, as with infantry, a
part) of the fire effect may be lost, and if the safe expedient of
&ldquo;combined sights&rdquo;<a name="fa10u" id="fa10u" href="#ft10u"><span class="sp">10</span></a> be too freely resorted to, the consumption
of ammunition may be out of all proportion.</p>

<p>The vulnerability of machine-guns is quite as important as is
their accuracy. At a minimum, that is when painted a &ldquo;service&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote">Vulnerability.</span>
colour, man&oelig;uvred with skill, and mounted on a low
tripod&mdash;in several armies even the shield has been
rejected as tending to make guns more conspicuous&mdash;the
vulnerability of one gun should be that of one skirmisher
lying down. At a maximum, vulnerability is that of a small
battery of guns and wagons limbered up.</p>

<p>Mobility comes next. The older patterns of hand-operated
guns weighed about 90 &#8468; at least, without carriage, the earlier
patterns of Maxims (such as that described in detail
above) about 60 &#8468;. But the most modern Maxims
<span class="sidenote">Mobility.</span>
weigh no more than 35 &#8468;. Now, such weapons with tripods
can be easily carried to and fro by one or two men over ground
that is impracticable for wheeled carriages. Nevertheless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>248</span>
wheeled carriages are often used for the ordinary transport of
the gun and its equipment, especially with the heavier models.
The simplest machine-gun has a number of accessories&mdash;tools,
spare parts, &amp;c.&mdash;that must be conveyed with it, and at the
least a pack-animal is indispensable.</p>

<p>Reducing these conditions to a phrase&mdash;the fire effect that
can be reasonably expected of machine-guns is that of fifty or
sixty rifles, the space it takes up in the line can be made to equal
that occupied by two men, and it possesses by turns the speed
of a mounted man and the freedom of movement of an infantryman.</p>

<p>The use of the machine-gun (apart from savage warfare) that
first commended itself in Europe was its use as a <i>mobile reserve
of fire</i>. Now, the greatest difficulty attending the
employment of a reserve of any sort is the selection
<span class="sidenote">Machine-Guns as a Reserve of Fire.</span>
of the right moment for its intervention in the
struggle, and experience of man&oelig;uvres of all arms
in Germany, where &ldquo;machine-gun detachments&rdquo; began to be
formed in 1902, appears to have been that the machine-guns
always came into action too late. On the other hand, the
conditions of the cavalry <i>versus</i> cavalry combat were more
favourable. Here there was every inducement to augment fire-power
without dismounting whole regiments for the purpose.
Moreover, vulnerability was not a fatal defect as against a
battery or two of the enemy&rsquo;s horse artillery, whose main task
is to fire with effect into the closed squadrons of mounted men
on the verge of their charge, and above all to avoid a meaningless
duel of projectiles. The use of wheeled carriages was therefore
quite admissible (although in fact the equipment was detachable
from the carriage) and, given the rapidity and sudden changes
of cavalry fighting, both desirable and necessary. Thus, thanks
<span class="sidenote">Machine-Guns with Cavalry.</span>
to the machine-gun, the eternal problem of increasing
the fire-power of mounted troops is at last partially
solved, and the solution has appealed strongly both
to armies exceptionally strong in cavalry, as for example
the German, and to those exceptionally weak in that arm&mdash;Denmark,
for instance, having two or three light machine-guns <i>per
squadron</i>. The object of the weaker cavalry may be to cause
the onset of the stronger to dwindle away into a dismounted
skirmish, and this is most effectually brought about by a fire
concentrated enough and heavy enough to discourage mounted
man&oelig;uvres; on the other hand, the stronger party desires to
avoid dismounting a single squadron that can be kept mounted;
and this too may be effected by the machine-guns. What the
result of such a policy on both sides may be, it would be hard
to prophesy, but it is clear at any rate that, whether on the
offensive or on the defensive, skilfully handled machine-guns
may enable a cavalry commander to achieve the difficult and
longed-for result&mdash;to <i>give the law</i> to his opponent. The
principal difference between the tactics of the stronger and those
of the weaker cavalry in this matter is, that it is generally
advantageous for the former to act by batteries and for the
latter to disperse his machine guns irregularly in pairs.</p>

<p>It is not merely in cavalry tactics that the question of
&ldquo;section or battery&rdquo; arises. It deeply affects the machine-gun
tactics in the battle of all arms, and it is therefore decided in each
service by the use to which the guns are intended to be put. One
powerful current of opinion is in favour of employing them as
a mobile reserve of fire. This opinion was responsible for the
creation of the German machine-gun batteries or &ldquo;detachments&rdquo;;
and in the drill regulations issued in 1902 for their
guidance it was stated that the proper use of machine-guns
required a comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the
general situation, and that therefore only the superior leaders
could employ them to advantage. Man&oelig;uvre experience, as
mentioned above, has caused considerable modification in this
matter, and while the large machine-gun &ldquo;detachments&rdquo; are
now definitely told off to the cavalry, new and smaller units
have been formed, with the title &ldquo;companies&rdquo; to indicate
their attachment to the infantry arm. A recent official
pronouncement as to the rôle of the &ldquo;companies&rdquo; (Amendments
to <i>Exerzierreglement für die Infanterie</i>, 1909) is to the effect
that the companies are an integral part of the infantry, that
their mission is to augment directly the fire of the infantry,
and that their employment is in the hands of the infantry regimental
commander, who keeps the guns at his own disposition
or distributes them to the battalions as he sees fit. It must be
remembered that the regiment is a large unit, 3000 strong,
and the idea of a &ldquo;mobile reserve of fire&rdquo; is tacitly maintained,
although it has been found necessary to depart from the extreme
measure of massing the guns and holding them at the disposal
of a general officer. The Japanese regulations state that in
principle the machine-gun battery fights as a unit; that although
<span class="sidenote">Machine-Guns in Combined Tactics.</span>
it may be advantageously employed with the advanced
guard to assure the possession of supporting
points, its true function is to intervene with full
effect in the decisive attack, its use in the delaying
action being &ldquo;a serious error.&rdquo; In France, on the other hand,
the system of independent sections is most rigidly maintained;
when in barracks, the three sections belonging to an infantry
regiment are combined for drill, but in the field they seem to be
used exclusively as sections. They are not, however, restricted
to the positions of their own battalions; taught probably by
the experiences of the British in South Africa, they co-operate
with instead of following the infantry. In Great Britain,
<i>Field Service Regulations</i>, part i., 1909, lay down that &ldquo;machine-guns
are best used in pairs<a name="fa11u" id="fa11u" href="#ft11u"><span class="sp">11</span></a> in support of the particular body of
troops to which they belong&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> battalions). &ldquo;The guns
of two or more units may, if required,<a name="fa12u" id="fa12u" href="#ft12u"><span class="sp">12</span></a> be placed under a
specially selected officer and employed as a special reserve of
fire in the hands of a brigade commander&rdquo; (corresponding to
German regimental commander), but &ldquo;if an overwhelming fire
on a particular point is required, it can be obtained by concentrating
the fire of dispersed pairs of guns.&rdquo; More explicitly
still, &ldquo;the movements and fire action of these weapons should
be <i>regulated so as to enable them to open fire immediately a favourable
opportunity arises.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Contrasting the German system with the French and English,
we may observe that it is German tactics <i>as a whole</i> that impose
a method of using machine-guns which the Germans themselves
recognize as being in many respects disadvantageous. A
German force in action possesses little depth, <i>i.e.</i> reserves, except
on the flanks where the enveloping attack is intended to be made.
Consequently, a German commander needs a reserve of fire in
a mechanical, concentrated form more than a British or a
French commander, and, further, as regards the decisive attack
on the flanks, it is intended not merely to be sudden but even
more to be powerful and overwhelming. These considerations
tend to impose both the massing and the holding in reserve of
machine-guns. The French and British doctrine (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tactics</a></span>)
is fundamentally different. Here, whether the guns be massed
or not, there is rarely any question of using the machine-guns
as a special reserve. In the decisive attack, and especially at
the culmination of the decisive attack, when concealment has
ceased and power is everything, the machine-guns can render
the greatest services when grouped and boldly handled. Above
all, they must reach the captured crest in a few minutes, so as
to crush the inevitable offensive return of the enemy&rsquo;s reserves.
The decisive attack, moreover, is not a prearranged affair, as in
Germany, but the culmination, &ldquo;at a selected point, of gradually
increasing pressure relentlessly applied to the enemy at all
points&rdquo; (<i>F. S. Regulations</i>). The holding attack, as this &ldquo;pressure&rdquo;
is called, is not a mere feint. It is launched and developed
as a decisive attack, though not completed as such, as it lacks
the necessary reserve strength. Here, then, the machine-gun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>249</span>
is best employed in enabling relatively small forces to
advance&mdash;not to assault&mdash;without undue loss, that is, in economizing
rifles along the non-decisive front.<a name="fa13u" id="fa13u" href="#ft13u"><span class="sp">13</span></a></p>

<p>Withal, there are certain principles, or rather details of
principle, that find general acceptance. One of these is the
employment of machine-guns with the advanced guard. In
this case the value of the weapon lies in its enabling the advanced
guard both to seize favourable ground and points of support
without undue effort and to hold the positions gained against
the enemy&rsquo;s counter-attack. This applies, further, to the
preliminary stages of an action.<a name="fa14u" id="fa14u" href="#ft14u"><span class="sp">14</span></a> Another point is that as
a rule the most favourable range for the machine-gun is
&ldquo;effective infantry,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> 600-1400 yards (which is, <i>mutatis
mutandis</i>, the principle of Reffye&rsquo;s mitrailleuse). Its employment
at close infantry range depends entirely on conditions
of ground and circumstances&mdash;even supposing that the handiest
and most inconspicuous type of weapon is employed. Thirdly&mdash;and
this has a considerable bearing on the other points&mdash;the
machine-gun both concentrates many rifles on a narrow front,
and concentrates the bullets of many rifles on a narrow front.
The first clause implies that it can be used where there is no
room (physically or tactically) for the fifty or eighty riflemen it
represents (as, for instance, in some slight patch of cover whence
the gun can give effective cross-fire in support of the infantry
attack, or in front of an advanced post, or can watch an exposed
flank), and, further, that it can be swung round laterally on to
a fresh target far more easily than a line of excited and extended
infantry can be made to change front. The second means that
the exit of a defile, an exposed turn in a lane or on a bridge, can
be beaten by closely grouped fire at greater distances and
with greater accuracy than is attainable with riflemen.</p>

<p>Further, the waste of ammunition and the strain on the
weapon caused by unnecessarily prolonged firing at the rate
for which its mechanism is set&mdash;varying between 350 and 700
rounds a minute&mdash;have caused it to be laid down as an axiom
in all armies that machine-guns shall deliver their fire by
&ldquo;bursts&rdquo; and only on favourable targets.</p>

<p>Lastly, the reports, both of observers and combatants, are
unanimous as to the immense moral effect produced on the
combatants by the unmistakable drumming sound of the
machine-guns, an effect comparable even at certain stages of the
fight to the boom of the artillery itself.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Equipments in Use</i>.&mdash;Practically all nations have abandoned the
simple wheeled carriage for machine-guns, or rather have adopted
the tripod or table mounting, reserving the wheeled vehicle for the
mere transport of the equipment. Since the Russo-Japanese War
the tendency has been to sacrifice the slight protection afforded by
the shield in order to reduce visibility. The Japanese, who had
unprotected field guns and protected machine-guns in the war,
found it advisable to reverse this procedure, for reasons that can
easily be guessed in the cases of both weapons.</p>

<p><i>Great Britain</i>.&mdash;The service machine-gun is the Maxim .303 in.,
adjusted to a rate of 450 rounds per minute and sighted (except in
a few weapons) to 2900 yards. The original patterns weighed
60 &#8468;, and were mounted on wheeled carriages. In the latest
pattern, however, the weight of the gun has been reduced to 36 &#8468;.
The old Mark I. cavalry Maxim carriage, complete with gun, ammunition,
&amp;c., weighed 13 cwt. behind the traces, and the gun was
5 ft. above the ground. It had no limber. The Mark III. cavalry
carriage is much lower (3&prime; 6&Prime; from the ground to the gun), and the
gun carriage and limber together only weigh 13 cwt. Of infantry
carriages there were various marks, one of which is shown in fig. 6.
Now, however, all mountings for infantry are of the tripod type,
transported on wheels or on pack animals, but entirely detachable
from the travelling mounting, and in action practically never used
except on the tripod. The Mark IV. tripod mounting, of which a
sketch is given in fig. 21, weighs 48 &#8468;. The total weight of the
fighting equipment is thus 84 &#8468; only&mdash;an important consideration
now that in action the gun is man-carried. The gun can be adjusted
to fire at heights varying from 2&prime; 6&Prime; to 1&prime; 2½&Prime; only from the ground;
in its lowest position, then, it is a little lower than the head of a man
firing lying. All the later infantry machine-gun equipments are
for pack transport and have no shields.</p>

<p>The organization of the machine-gun arm is regimental. Each
cavalry regiment and each infantry battalion has a section of 2 guns
under an officer.</p>

<p><i>France</i>.&mdash;The guns in use are the Puteaux and the Hotchkiss.
The unit is the regimental 2-gun section. Four-horsed carriages
with limbers are used with cavalry, tripods with the infantry
sections. No shields. Weight of the Hotchkiss in use, 50 &#8468;; of
the tripod, 70 &#8468;. The Puteaux was lightened and improved in
1909.</p>

<p><i>Germany</i>.&mdash;As already mentioned the German machine-gun units
are classed as cavalry &ldquo;detachments&rdquo; and infantry &ldquo;companies.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;detachment&rdquo; or battery consists of 6 guns and 4 wagons,
the vehicles being of a light artillery pattern and drawn by four
horses. The gun (Maxim) weighs 61 &#8468;, and its fighting carriage
110 &#8468;. The &ldquo;companies&rdquo; have also 6 guns and 4 wagons, but the
equipment is lighter (two-horse), and is not constructed on artillery
principles, nor are the guns fired from their carriages as are those
of the &ldquo;detachments.&rdquo; The weight of the gun is 38 &#8468;, and that of
the fighting carriage 75 (some accounts give 53 for the latter), the
difference between these weights and those of the mounted equipments,
affording a good illustration of the difference in the tactical
requirements of the cavalry and of the infantry types of gun. The
fighting carriage is a sort of sledge, which is provided with four legs
for fire in the highest position, but can of course be placed on the
ground; the height of the gun, therefore, can be varied from 3&prime; 6&Prime; to
1&prime; 6&Prime;. The sledges can be dragged across country or carried by
men stretcher fashion, and sometimes several sledges are coupled
and drawn by a horse.</p>

<p><i>Japan</i>.&mdash;The Japanese Hotchkiss, as modified since the war with
Russia, is said to weigh 70 &#8468;, and its tripod mounting 40. Each
regiment of infantry has a six-gun battery and each cavalry brigade
one of eight guns. Pack transport is used.</p>

<p><i>Russia</i>.&mdash;Since the war eight-gun companies have been formed
in the infantry regiments, and each cavalry regiment has been
provided with two guns. The var organization is, however, unknown.
Both wheel and pack transport are employed for travelling,
but the guns are fought from tripods. Early and somewhat heavy
patterns of Maxim (with shield) are chiefly used, but a great number
of very light guns of the Madsen type have been issued.</p>

<p>The <i>Austrian</i> gun is the Schwarzlose, of which some details are
given above. Pack transport is used, one mule taking the whole
equipment with 1000 rounds. Weight of the gun 37.9 &#8468;, of the
tripod 41 &#8468;. The height of the tripod can be varied from 9¾ in.
to 2 ft. above the ground. It is proposed that each cavalry regiment
should have four guns, and each infantry regiment two. Switzerland
adopted the Maxim in 1902. It is used principally as a substitute
for horse artillery. <i>Denmark</i> and other small states have adopted
the Madsen or Rexer light-type guns in relatively large numbers,
especially for cavalry. In the <i>United States</i> the British organization
was after many trials adopted, and each infantry and cavalry
regiment has a two-gun section of Maxims, with tripod mounting
and pack transport.</p>

<p><a name="ft1u" id="ft1u" href="#fa1u"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The French term <i>mitrailleuse</i>, made famous by the War of 1870,
reappears in other Latin tongues (<i>e.g.</i> Spanish <i>ametralladora</i>). It
signifies a weapon which delivers a shower of small projectiles
(<i>mitraille</i>&mdash;grape or case shot), and has no special reference to its
mechanical (hand or automatic) action.</p>

<p><a name="ft2u" id="ft2u" href="#fa2u"><span class="fn">2</span></a> Meudon Château had long been used for military experiments.
The peasantry credited it with mysterious and terrible secrets,
asserting even that it contained a tannery of human skins, this
tradition perhaps relating to the war balloon constructed there
before the battle of Fleurus (1794). Reffye had also many non-military
tasks, such as the reproduction of a famous set of bas-reliefs,
construction of aeroplanes, and the reconstruction of triremes and
balistas.</p>

<p><a name="ft3u" id="ft3u" href="#fa3u"><span class="fn">3</span></a> A machine-gun of the artillery or volley type, called the &ldquo;Requa
battery,&rdquo; which had its barrels disposed fan-wise, was also used in
the Civil War.</p>

<p><a name="ft4u" id="ft4u" href="#fa4u"><span class="fn">4</span></a> The U.S. pattern Gatling hardly differed except in details from
the model, above described, of twenty years earlier. The drum
had been set horizontally instead of vertically and improved in details,
and a &ldquo;gravity feed,&rdquo; a tall vertical charger, was also used.
The barrels were surrounded with a light casing. Tests made
of the improved Gatling showed that the use of only one barrel
at a time prevented overheating. On one trial 63,000 rounds were
fired without a jam, and without stopping to clean the barrels.
Smokeless powder and the modern cartridge case were of course
used.</p>

<p><a name="ft5u" id="ft5u" href="#fa5u"><span class="fn">5</span></a> The following particulars may be given of the 2-barrelled
Gardner and 3-barrelled Nordenfeldt (land service) converted to
take the .303 cartridge: Weight, 92 and 110 &#8468; respectively;
parapet mounting in each case 168 &#8468;; rate of fire of Gardner about
250 rounds per minute, of the Nordenfeldt about 350. A few of
these guns are still used in fortresses and coast defences.</p>

<p><a name="ft6u" id="ft6u" href="#fa6u"><span class="fn">6</span></a> Modern improvements in mechanical details are only slight,
as may be found by reference to the official handbooks of the gun,
editions of 1903 and 1907.</p>

<p><a name="ft7u" id="ft7u" href="#fa7u"><span class="fn">7</span></a> At San-de-pu 1905 the Japanese machine-guns (Hotchkiss)
sustained damage averaging, 1 extractor broken per gun, 1 jam in
every 300 rounds. It should be mentioned, however, that the
machine-gun companies were only formed shortly before the battle.</p>

<p><a name="ft10u" id="ft10u" href="#fa10u"><span class="fn">10</span></a> &ldquo;Combined sights&rdquo; implies firing with the sights set for two
different ranges, the usual difference being 50 yds. With grouped
machine guns, &ldquo;progressive fire&rdquo; with elevations increasing by 25
yds. is used. This artificially disperses the fire, and therefore lessens
the chance of losing the target through ranging errors. One ingenious
inventor has produced a two-barrelled automatic, in which the
barrels are permanently set to give combined elevations. The
British memorandum of August 1909 seems to regard the facility of
employing combined sights as the principal advantage of the battery
over the section.</p>

<p><a name="ft11u" id="ft11u" href="#fa11u"><span class="fn">11</span></a> The use of single guns facilitates concealment, but this is outweighed
by the objection that when a jam or other breakdown
occurs the fire ceases altogether. The use of guns in pairs not only
obviates this, but admits of each gun in turn ceasing fire to economize
ammunition, to cool down, &amp;c. This is the old artillery principle&mdash;&ldquo;one
gun is no gun.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="ft12u" id="ft12u" href="#fa12u"><span class="fn">12</span></a> In the instructions issued in August 1909 one of the principal
advantages of grouped sections is stated to be the neutralization of
ranging errors at ranges over 1000 yards. At a less range, it is
laid down, grouped guns form too visible a target, unless the
ground is very favourable.</p>

<p><a name="ft13u" id="ft13u" href="#fa13u"><span class="fn">13</span></a> The British instructions of August 1909 direct the grouping of
guns in the <i>decisive</i> attack (if circumstances and ground favour this
course) and their use by sections &ldquo;if the brigade is deployed on a
wide front,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> on the <i>non-decisive</i> front; further, that it is often
advisable to disperse the sections of the leading battalions and to
group those of units in reserve. In any case, while the 2, 4 or 8
guns must be ready to act independently as a special &ldquo;arm,&rdquo; their
normal work is to give the closest support to the neighbouring
infantry (battalion in the holding, brigade in the decisive, attack).</p>

<p><a name="ft14u" id="ft14u" href="#fa14u"><span class="fn">14</span></a> In Germany, however, the tendency is not to make holding
attacks but to keep the troops out of harm&rsquo;s way (<i>i.e.</i> too far away
for the enemy to counter-attack) until they can strike effectively.</p>

He is represented by five poems in the <i>Cancianero de Baena</i>,

was murdered by the jealous husband while singing the lady&rsquo;s
praises. There may be some basis of fact for this narrative,
which became a favourite subject with contemporary Spanish
poets and later writers. Macías is mentioned in Rocaberti&rsquo;s

the Caledonian Asylum, London, and in Brussels. In 1830,
being then private secretary to a Belgian ironmaster, he began
writing verses and articles for local newspapers. Returning
to London, he devoted himself to literary and journalistic
work, and was attached to the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> (1835-1844).
He published <i>Memoirs of Extraordinary Public Delusions</i> (1841),

prolific journalist. In 1844 he was made editor of the Glasgow
<i>Argus</i>. His literary reputation was made by the publication
in 1846 of a volume of verses. <i>Voices from the Crowd</i>, some of
which were set to music by Henry Russell and became very
popular. In 1848 Mackay returned to London and worked

accompanied it to France when it was lent by Charles II. to
Louis XIV., and though succeeding, through the death of his
two elder brothers, to his father&rsquo;s estates, continued to serve
abroad. In 1669 he was in the Venetian service at Candia,
and in 1672 he was back with his old regiment, Dumbarton&rsquo;s,
in the French army, taking part under Turenne in the invasion
of Holland. In 1673 he married Clara de Bie of Bommel
in Gelderland. Through her influence he became, as Burnet
says, &ldquo;the most pious man that I ever knew in a military
way,&rdquo; and, convinced that he was fighting in an unjust cause,
resigned his commission to take a captaincy in a Scottish
regiment in the Dutch service. He had risen to the rank of
major-general in 1685, when the Scots brigade was called to
England to assist in the suppression of the Monmouth rebellion.
Returning to Holland, Mackay was one of those officers who
elected to stay with their men when James II., having again
demanded the services of the Scots brigade, and having been met
with a refusal, was permitted to invite the officers individually
into his service. As major-general commanding the brigade,
and also as a privy councillor of Scotland, Mackay was an
important and influential person, and James chose to attribute
the decision of most of the officers to Mackay&rsquo;s instigation.
Soon after this event the Prince of Orange started on his
expedition to England, Mackay&rsquo;s division leading the invading
corps, and in January 1688-89 Mackay was appointed major-general
commanding in chief in Scotland. In this capacity
he was called upon to deal with the formidable insurrection
headed by Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee. In
the battle of Killiecrankie Mackay was severely defeated, but
Dundee was killed, and the English commander, displaying
unexpected energy, subdued the Highlands in one summer.
In 1690 he founded Fort William at Inverlochy, in 1691 he
distinguished himself in the brilliant victory of Aughrim,
and in 1692, with the rank of lieutenant-general, he commanded
the British division of the allied army in Flanders. At the
great battle of Steinkirk Mackay&rsquo;s division bore the brunt of
the day unsupported and the general himself was killed.</p>

<p>Mackay was the inventor of the ring bayonet which
soon came into general use, the idea of this being suggested
to him by the failure of the plug-bayonet to stop the rush of
the Highlanders at Killiecrankie. Many of his despatches
and papers were published by the Bannatyne Club in 1883.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACKAY, JOHN WILLIAM<a name="ar193" id="ar193"></a></span> (1831-1902), American capitalist,
was born in Dublin, Ireland, on the 28th of November
1831. His parents brought him in 1840 to New York City,
where he worked in a ship-yard. In 1851 he went to California
and worked in placer gold-mines in Sierra county. In 1852
he went to Virginia City, Nevada, and there, after losing all
he had made in California, he formed with James G. Fair,
James C. Flood and William S. O&rsquo;Brien the firm which in 1873
discovered the great Bonanza vein, more than 1200 ft. deep,
in the Comstock lode (yielding in March of that year as much
as $632 per ton, and in 1877 nearly $19,000,000 altogether);
and this firm established the Bank of Nevada in San Francisco.
In 1884, with James Gordon Bennett, Mackay formed
the Commercial Cable Company&mdash;largely to fight Jay
Gould and the Western Union Telegraph Company&mdash;laid
two transatlantic cables, and forced the toll-rate for transatlantic
messages down to twenty-five cents a word. In
connexion with the Commercial Cable Company he formed
the Postal Telegraph Company. Mackay died on the 20th
of July 1902 in London. He gave generously, especially to
the charities of the Roman Catholic Church, and endowed
the Roman Catholic orphan asylum in Virginia City, Nevada.
In June 1908 a school of mines was presented to the University
of Nevada, as a memorial to him, by his widow and his son,
Clarence H. Mackay.</p>

on the Pioneer river, 625 m. direct N.N.W. Pop. (1901), 4091.
The harbour is not good. Sugar, tobacco and coffee thrive
in the district. There are several important sugar mills, one
of which, the largest in Queensland, is capable of an annual
output of 8000 tons. Rum is distilled, and there are a brewery
and a factory for tinning butter for export. Workable coal
is found in the district. This is the port of the Mt Orange
and Mt Gotthart copper mines, and the Mt Britten and Eungella
gold-fields. It is a calling-station for the Queensland
royal mail steamers. The town is named after Captain John
Mackay, who discovered the harbour in 1860.</p>

by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, the Pittsburg &amp; Lake Erie and the
Pennsylvania railways. The city has a Carnegie library, a
general hospital, and two business schools. Bituminous coal
and natural gas abound in the vicinity, and iron, steel, and tin
and terne plate are extensively manufactured in the city, the
tin-plate plant being one of the most important in the United

$36,058,447 in 1900 and $23,054,412 in 1905. The municipality
owns and operates its water-works. The first white settler was
David McKee, who established a ferry here in 1769. In 1795
his son John laid out the town, which was named in his honour,
but its growth was very slow until after the discovery of coal in
1830. McKeesport was incorporated as a borough in 1842 and
chartered as a city in 1890.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACKENNAL, ALEXANDER<a name="ar197" id="ar197"></a></span> (1835-1904), English Nonconformist
divine, was born at Truro in Cornwall, on the 14th of
January 1835, the son of Patrick Mackennal, a Scot, who had
settled in Cornwall. In 1848 the family removed to London,
and at sixteen he went to Glasgow University. In 1854 he
entered Hackney College to prepare for the Congregational
ministry, and in 1857 he graduated B.A. at London University.
After holding pastorates at Burton-on-Trent (1856-1861),
Surbiton (1862-1870), Leicester (1870-1876), he finally
accepted the pastorate of the Congregational Church at Bowdon,
Cheshire, in 1877, in which he remained till his death. In 1886
he was chairman of the Congregational Union, which he represented
in 1889 at the triannual national council of the American
Congregational churches. The first international council of
Congregationalists held in London in 1891 was partly cause,
partly consequence, of his visit, and Mackennal acted as secretary.
In 1892 he became definitely associated in the public
mind with a movement for free church federation which grew
out of a series of meetings held to discuss the question of home
reunion. When the Lambeth articles put forward as a basis
of union were discussed, it was evident that all the free churches
were agreed in accepting the three articles dealing with the
Bible, the Creed and the Sacraments as a basis of discussion,
and were also agreed in rejecting the fourth article, which put
the historic episcopate on the same level as the other three.
Omitting the Anglicans, the representatives of the remaining
churches resolved to develop Christian fellowship by united
action and worship wherever possible. Out of this grew the
Free Church Federation, which secures a measure of co-operation
between the Protestant Evangelical churches throughout England.
Mackennal&rsquo;s public action brought him into association
with many well-known political and religious leaders. He
was a lifelong advocate of international peace, and made a
remarkable declaration as to the Christian standard of national
action when the Free Church Federation met at Leeds during
the South African War in 1900.</p>

<p>Besides a volume of sermons under the title <i>Christ&rsquo;s Healing
Touch</i>, Mackennal published <i>The Biblical Scheme of Nature and
of Man, The Christian Testimony, the Letters to the Seven
Churches of Asia, The Kingdom of the Lord Jesus</i> and <i>The
Eternal God and the Human Sonship</i>. These are contributions
to exegetical study or to theological and progressive religious
thought, and have elements of permanent value. He also made
some useful contributions to religious history. In 1893 he
published the <i>Story of the English Separatists</i>, and later the <i>Homes
and Haunts of the Pilgrim Fathers</i>; he also wrote the life of
Dr J. A. Macfadyen of Manchester. In 1901 he delivered a
series of lectures at Hartford Theological Seminary, Connecticut,
U.S.A., published under the title <i>The Evolution of Congregationalism</i>.
He died at Highgate on the 23rd of June 1904.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACKENZIE, SIR ALEXANDER<a name="ar198" id="ar198"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1755-1820), Canadian
explorer, was probably a native of Inverness, Emigrating to
North America at an early age, he was for several years engaged
in the fur trade at Fort Chippewyan, at the head of Lake Athabasca,
and it was here that his schemes of travel were formed.
His first journey, made in 1789, was from Fort Chippewyan
along the Great Slave Lake, and down the river which now bears
his name to the Arctic Ocean; and his second, made in 1792 and
1793, from Fort Chippewyan across the Rocky Mountains to
the Pacific coast near Cape Menzies. He wrote an account of
these journeys, <i>Voyages on the River St Lawrence and through
the Continent of North America to the Frozen and Pacific Oceans</i>
(London, 1801), which is of considerable interest from the
information it contains about the native tribes. It is prefaced
by an historical dissertation on the Canadian fur trade. Amassing
considerable wealth, Mackenzie was knighted in 1802, and
later settled in Scotland. He died at Mulnain, near Dunkeld, on
the 11th of March 1820.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACKENZIE, ALEXANDER<a name="ar199" id="ar199"></a></span> (1822-1892), Canadian statesman,
was born in Perthshire, Scotland, on the 28th of January,
1822. His father was a builder, and young Mackenzie emigrated
to Canada in 1842, and worked in Ontario as a stone-mason,
setting up for himself later as a builder and contractor at Sarnia
with his brother. In 1852 his interest in questions of reform led
to his becoming the editor of the <i>Lambton Shield</i>, a local Liberal
paper. This brought him to the front, and in 1861 he became a
member of the Canadian parliament, where he at once made his
mark and was closely connected with the liberal leader, George
Brown. He was elected for Lambton to the first Dominion
house of commons in 1867, and soon became the leader of the
liberal opposition; from 1871 to 1872 he also sat in the Ontario
provincial assembly, and held the position of provincial
treasurer. In 1873 the attack on Sir John Macdonald&rsquo;s ministry
with regard to the Pacific Railway charter resulted in its defeat,
and Mackenzie formed a new government, taking the portfolio
of public works and becoming the first liberal premier of Canada.
He remained in power till 1878, when industrial depression
enabled Macdonald to return to office on a protectionist programme.
In 1875 Mackenzie paid a visit to Great Britain, and
was received at Windsor by Queen Victoria; he was offered a
knighthood, but declined it. After his defeat he suffered from
failing health, gradually resulting in almost total paralysis, but
though in 1880 he resigned the leadership of the opposition, he
retained a seat in parliament till his death at Toronto on the 17th
of April 1892. While perhaps too cautious to be the ideal leader
of a young and vigorous community, his grasp of detail, indefatigable
industry, and unbending integrity won him the respect
even of his political opponents.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACKENZIE, SIR ALEXANDER CAMPBELL<a name="ar200" id="ar200"></a></span> (1847-&emsp;&emsp;),
British composer, son of an eminent Edinburgh violinist and
conductor, was born on the 22nd of August 1847. On the advice
of a member of Gung&rsquo;l&rsquo;s band who had taken up his residence in
Edinburgh, Mackenzie was sent for his musical education to
Sondershausen, where he entered the conservatorium under
Ulrich and Stein, remaining there from 1857 to 1861, when he
entered the ducal orchestra as a violinist. At this time he made
Liszt&rsquo;s acquaintance. On his return home he won the King&rsquo;s
Scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music, and remained the
usual three years in the institution, after which he established
himself as a teacher of the piano, &amp;c., in Edinburgh. He
appeared in public as a violinist, taking part in Chappell&rsquo;s
quartette concerts, and starting a set of classical concerts. He
was appointed precentor of St George&rsquo;s Church in 1870, and
conductor of the Scottish vocal music association in 1873, at the
same time getting through a prodigious amount of teaching.
He kept in touch with his old friends by playing in the orchestra
of the Birmingham Festivals from 1864 to 1873. The most
important compositions of this period of Mackenzie&rsquo;s life were
the Quartette in E flat for piano and strings. Op. 11, and an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>252</span>
overture, <i>Cervantes</i>, which owed its first performance to the
encouragement and help of von Bülow. On the advice of this
great pianist, he gave up his Edinburgh appointments, which
had quite worn him out, and settled in Florence in order to
compose. The cantatas <i>The Bride</i> (Worcester, 1881) and <i>Jason</i>
(Bristol, 1882) belong to this time, as well as his first opera. This
was commissioned for the Carl Rosa Company, and was written
to a version of Merimée&rsquo;s <i>Colomba</i> prepared by Franz Hueffer.
It was produced with great success in 1883, and was the first
of a too short series of modern English operas; Mackenzie&rsquo;s
second opera, <i>The Troubadour</i>, was produced by the same
company in 1886; and his third dramatic work was <i>His Majesty</i>,
an excellent comic opera (Savoy Theatre, 1897). In 1884 his
<i>Rose of Sharon</i> was given with very great success at the Norwich
Festival; in 1885 he was appointed conductor of Novello&rsquo;s
oratorio concerts; <i>The Story of Sayid</i> came out at the Leeds
Festival of 1886; and in 1888 he succeeded Macfarren as principal
of the Royal Academy of Music. <i>The Dream of Jubal</i> was produced
at Liverpool in 1889, and in London very soon afterwards.
A fine setting of the hymn &ldquo;Veni, Creator Spiritus&rdquo; was given
at Birmingham in 1891, and the oratorio <i>Bethlehem</i> in 1894.
From 1892 to 1899 he conducted the Philharmonic Concerts,
and was knighted in 1894. Besides the works mentioned he
has written incidental music to plays, as, for instance, to <i>Ravenswood</i>,
<i>The Little Minister</i>, and <i>Coriolanus</i>; concertos and other
works for violin and orchestra, much orchestral music, and many
songs and violin pieces. The romantic side of music appeals
to Mackenzie far more strongly than any other, and the cases in
which he has conformed to the classical conventions are of the
rarest. In the orchestral ballad, <i>La Belle Dame sans Merci</i>, he
touches the note of weird pathos, and in the nautical overture
<i>Britannia</i> his sense of humour stands revealed. In the two
&ldquo;Scottish Rhapsodies&rdquo; for orchestra, in the music to <i>The Little
Minister</i>, and in a beautiful fantasia for pianoforte and orchestra
on Scottish themes, he has seized the essential, not the accidental
features of his native music.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACKENZIE, SIR GEORGE<a name="ar201" id="ar201"></a></span> (1636-1691), of Rosehaugh,
Scottish lawyer, was the grandson of Kenneth, first Lord Mackenzie
of Kintail, and the nephew of Colin and George, first and
second earls of Seaforth; his mother was a daughter of Andrew
Bruce, principal of St Leonard&rsquo;s College, St Andrews. He was
born at Dundee in 1636, educated at the grammar school there
and at Aberdeen, and afterwards at St Andrews, graduating
at sixteen. He then engaged for three years in the study of
the civil law at Bourges; on his return to Scotland he was called
to the bar in 1659, and before the Restoration had risen into
considerable practice. Immediately after the Restoration he
was appointed a &ldquo;justice-depute,&rdquo; and it is recorded that he
and his colleagues in that office were ordained by the parliament
in 1661 &ldquo;to repair, once in the week at least, to Musselburgh
and Dalkeith, and to try and judge such persons as are there or
thereabouts delate of witchcraft.&rdquo; In the same year he acted
as counsel for the marquis of Argyll; soon afterwards he was
knighted, and he represented the county of Ross during the four
sessions of the parliament which was called in 1669. He succeeded
Sir John Nisbet as king&rsquo;s advocate in August 1677, and in
the discharge of this office became implicated in all the worst acts
of the Scottish administration of Charles II., earning for himself
an unenviable distinction as &ldquo;the bloody Mackenzie.&rdquo; His
refusal to concur in the measures for dispensing with the penal
laws against Catholics led to his removal from office in 1686, but
he was reinstated in February 1688. At the Revolution, being
a member of convention, he was one of the minority of five
in the division on the forfeiture of the crown. King William
was urged to declare him incapacitated for holding any public
office, but refused to accede to the proposal. When the
death of Dundee (July 1689) had finally destroyed the hopes
of his party in Scotland, Mackenzie betook himself to Oxford,
where, admitted a student by a grace passed in 1690, he was
allowed to spend the rest of his days in the enjoyment of the
ample fortune he had acquired, and in the prosecution of
his literary labours. One of his last acts before leaving Edinburgh
had been to pronounce (March 15, 1689), as dean of
the faculty of advocates, the inaugural oration at the foundation
of the Advocates&rsquo; library. He died at Westminster on the
8th of May 1691, and was buried in Greyfriars churchyard,
Edinburgh.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>While still a young man Sir George Mackenzie appears to have
aspired to eminence in the domain of pure literature, his earliest
publication having been <i>Aretina, or a Serious Romance</i> (anon., 1661);
it was followed, also anonymously, by <i>Religio Stoici, a Short Discourse
upon Several Divine and Moral Subjects</i> (1663); <i>A Moral Essay,
preferring Solitude to Public Employment</i> (1665); and one or two
other disquisitions of a similar nature. His most important legal
works are entitled <i>A Discourse upon the Laws and Customs of Scotland
in Matters Criminal</i> (1674); <i>Observations upon the Laws and Customs
of Nations as to Precedency, with the Science of Heraldry</i> (1680);
<i>Institutions of the Law of Scotland</i> (1684); and <i>Observations upon the
Acts of Parliament</i> (1686); of these the last-named is the most
important, the <i>Institutions</i> being completely overshadowed by the
similar work of his great contemporary Stair. In his <i>Jus Regium:
or the Just and Solid Foundations of Monarchy in general, and more
especially of the Monarchy of Scotland, maintained</i> (1684), Mackenzie
appears as an uncompromising advocate of the highest doctrines of
prerogative. His <i>Vindication of the Government of Scotland during
the reign of Charles II.</i> (1691) is valuable as a piece of contemporary
history. The collected <i>Works</i> were published at Edinburgh (2 vols.
fol.) in 1716-1722; and <i>Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland from the
Restoration of King Charles II.</i>, from previously unpublished MSS.,
in 1821.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACKENZIE, HENRY<a name="ar202" id="ar202"></a></span> (1745-1831), Scottish novelist and
miscellaneous writer, was born at Edinburgh in August 1745.
His father, Joshua Mackenzie, was a distinguished physician,
and his mother, Margaret Rose, belonged to an old Nairnshire
family. Mackenzie was educated at the high school and the
university of Edinburgh, and was then articled to George Inglis
of Redhall, who was attorney for the crown in the management
of exchequer business. In 1765 he was sent to London to prosecute
his legal studies, and on his return to Edinburgh became
partner with Inglis, whom he afterwards succeeded as attorney
for the crown. His first and most famous work, <i>The Man of
Feeling</i>, was published anonymously in 1771, and met with
instant success. The &ldquo;Man of Feeling&rdquo; is a weak creature,
dominated by a futile benevolence, who goes up to London and
falls into the hands of people who exploit his innocence. The
sentimental key in which the book is written shows the author&rsquo;s
acquaintance with Sterne and Richardson, but he had neither
the humour of Sterne nor the subtle insight into character of
Richardson. One Eccles of Bath claimed the authorship of this
book, bringing in support of his pretensions a MS. with many
ingenious erasures. Mackenzie&rsquo;s name was then officially announced,
but Eccles appears to have induced some people to
believe in him. In 1773 Mackenzie published a second novel,
<i>The Man of the World</i>, the hero of which was as consistently bad
as the &ldquo;Man of Feeling&rdquo; had been &ldquo;constantly obedient to his
moral sense,&rdquo; as Sir Walter Scott says. <i>Julia de Roubigné</i> (1777),
a story in letters, was preferred to his other novels by &ldquo;Christopher
North,&rdquo; who had a high opinion of Mackenzie (see <i>Noctes
Ambrosianae</i>, vol. i. p. 155, ed. 1866). The first of his dramatic
pieces, <i>The Prince of Tunis</i>, was produced in Edinburgh in 1773
with a certain measure of success. The others were failures. At
Edinburgh Mackenzie belonged to a literary club, at the meetings
of which papers in the manner of the <i>Spectator</i> were read. This
led to the establishment of a weekly periodical called the <i>Mirror</i>
(January 23, 1779-May 27, 1780), of which Mackenzie was
editor and chief contributor. It was followed in 1785 by a
similar paper, the <i>Lounger</i>, which ran for nearly two years and
had the distinction of containing one of the earliest tributes to
the genius of Robert Burns. Mackenzie was an ardent Tory,
and wrote many tracts intended to counteract the doctrines of the
French Revolution. Most of these remained anonymous, but
he acknowledged his <i>Review of the Principal Proceedings of the
Parliament of 1784</i>, a defence of the policy of William Pitt,
written at the desire of Henry Dundas. He was rewarded (1804)
by the office of comptroller of the taxes for Scotland. In
1776 Mackenzie married Penuel, daughter of Sir Ludovick
Grant of Grant. He was, in his later years, a notable figure in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span>
Edinburgh society. He was nicknamed the &ldquo;man of feeling,&rdquo;
but he was in reality a hard-headed man of affairs with a kindly
heart. Some of his literary reminiscences were embodied in his
<i>Account of the Life and Writings of John Home, Esq.</i> (1822). He
also wrote a <i>Life of Doctor Blacklock</i>, prefixed to the 1793
edition of the poet&rsquo;s works. He died on the 14th of January
1831.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1807 <i>The Works of Henry Mackenzie</i> were published surreptitiously,
and he then himself superintended the publication of his
<i>Works</i> (8 vols., 1808). There is an admiring but discriminating
criticism of his work in the <i>Prefatory Memoir</i> prefixed by Sir Walter
Scott to an edition of his novels in Ballantyne&rsquo;s <i>Novelist&rsquo;s Library</i>

<p><span class="bold">McKENZIE, SIR JOHN<a name="ar203" id="ar203"></a></span> (1838-1901). New Zealand statesman,
was born at Ard-Ross, Scotland, in 1838, the son of a crofter.
He emigrated to Otago, New Zealand, in 1860. Beginning as a
shepherd, he rose to be farm manager at Puketapu near Palmerston
South, and then to be a farmer in a substantial way in
Shag Valley. In 1865 he was clerk to the local road board
and school committee; in 1871 he entered the provincial council
of Otago; and on the 11th of December 1881 was elected member
of the House of Representatives, in which he sat till 1900. He
was also for some years a member of the education board and
of the land board of Otago, and always showed interest in the
national elementary school system. In the House of Representatives
he soon made good his footing, becoming almost at once
a recognized spokesman for the smaller sort of rural settlers
and a person of influence in the lobbies. He acted as government
whip for the coalition ministry of Sir Robert Stout and Sir
Julius Vogel, 1884-1887, and, while still a private member, scored
his first success as a land reformer by carrying the &ldquo;McKenzie
clause&rdquo; in a land act limiting the area which a state tenant
might thenceforth obtain on lease. He was still, however,
comparatively unknown outside his own province when, in
January 1891, his party took office and he aided John Ballance
in forming a ministry, in which he himself held the portfolio of
lands, immigration and agriculture. From the first he made
his hand felt in every matter connected with land settlement
and the administration of the vast public estate. Generally his
aim was to break up and subdivide the great freehold and leasehold
properties which in his time covered four-sevenths of the
occupied land of the colony. In his Land Act of 1892 he consolidated,
abolished or amended, fifty land acts and ordinances
dealing with crown lands, and thereafter amended his own act
four times. Though owning to a preference for state tenancy
over freehold, he never stopped the selling of crown land, and
was satisfied to give would-be settlers the option of choosing
freehold or leasehold under tempting terms as their form of
tenure. As a compromise he introduced the lease in perpetuity
or holding for 999 years at a quit rent fixed at 4%; theoretical
objections have since led to its abolition, but for fifteen years
much genuine settlement took place under its conditions.
Broadly, however, McKenzie&rsquo;s exceptional success as lands
minister was due rather to unflinching determination to stimulate
the occupation of the soil by working farmers than to the
solution of the problems of agrarian controversy. His best-known
experiment was in land repurchase. A voluntary law
(1892) was displaced by a compulsory act (1894), under which
between £5,000,000 and £6,000,000 had by 1910 been spent in
buying and subdividing estates for closer settlements, with
excellent results. McKenzie also founded and expanded an
efficient department of agriculture, in the functions of which
inspection, grading, teaching and example are successfully
combined. It has aided the development of dairying, fruit-growing,
poultry-farming, bee-keeping and flax-milling, and
done not a little to keep up the standard of New Zealand products.
After 1897 McKenzie had to hold on in the face of failing
health. An operation in London in 1899 only postponed the
end. He died at his farm on the 6th of August 1901, soon after
being called to the legislative council, and receiving a knighthood.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACKENZIE, SIR MORELL<a name="ar204" id="ar204"></a></span> (1837-1892), British physician,
son of Stephen Mackenzie, surgeon (d. 1851), was born at Leytonstone,
Essex, on the 7th of July 1837. After going through the
course at the London Hospital, and becoming M.R.C.S. in 1858,
he studied abroad at Paris, Vienna and Pesth; and at Pesth he
learnt the use of the newly-invented laryngoscope under J. N.
Czermak. Returning to London in 1862, he worked at the
London Hospital, and took his degree in medicine. In 1863
he won the Jacksonian prize at the Royal College of Surgeons
for an essay on the &ldquo;Pathology of the Larynx,&rdquo; and he then devoted
himself to becoming a specialist in diseases of the throat.
In 1863 the Throat Hospital in King Street, Golden Square, was
founded, largely owing to his initiative, and by his work there and
at the London Hospital (where he was one of the physicians
from 1866 to 1873) Morell Mackenzie rapidly became recognized
throughout Europe as a leading authority, and acquired an
extensive practice. So great was his reputation that in May
1887, when the crown prince of Germany (afterwards the emperor
Frederick III.) was attacked by the affection of the throat of which
he ultimately died, Morell Mackenzie was specially summoned
to attend him. The German physicians who had attended the
prince since the beginning of March (Karl Gerhardt, and subsequently
Tobold, E. von Bergmann, and others) had diagnosed
his ailment on the 18th of May as cancer of the throat; but Morell
Mackenzie insisted (basing his opinion on a microscopical examination
by R. Virchow of a portion of the tissue) that the
disease was not demonstrably cancerous, that an operation for
the extirpation of the larynx (planned for the 21st of May) was
unjustifiable, and that the growth might well be a benign one
and therefore curable by other treatment. The question was
one not only of personal but of political importance, since it was
doubted whether any one suffering from an incapacitating disease
like cancer could, according to the family law of the Hohenzollerns,
occupy the German throne; and there was talk of a renunciation
of the succession by the crown prince. It was freely hinted,
moreover, that some of the doctors themselves were influenced
by political considerations. At any rate, Morell Mackenzie&rsquo;s
opinion was followed: the crown prince went to England, under
his treatment, and was present at the Jubilee celebrations in
June. Morell Mackenzie was knighted in September 1887 for his
services, and decorated with the Grand Cross of the Hohenzollern
Order. In November, however, the German doctors were again
called into consultation, and it was ultimately admitted that the
disease really was cancer; though Mackenzie, with very questionable
judgment, more than hinted that it had become malignant
since his first examination, in consequence of the irritating effect
of the treatment by the German doctors. The crown prince
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Frederick III.</a></span>) became emperor on the 9th of March 1888,
and died on the 15th of June. During all this period a violent
quarrel raged between Sir Morell Mackenzie and the German
medical world. The German doctors published an account of
the illness, to which Mackenzie replied by a work entitled
<i>The Fatal Illness of Frederick the Noble</i> (1888), the publication
of which caused him to be censured by the Royal College of
Surgeons. After this sensational episode in his career, the
remainder of Sir Morell Mackenzie&rsquo;s life was uneventful, and
he died somewhat suddenly in London, on the 3rd of February
1892. He published several books on laryngoscopy and diseases
of the throat.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MACKENZIE, WILLIAM LYON<a name="ar205" id="ar205"></a></span> (1795-1861), Canadian politician,
was born near Dundee, Scotland, on the 12th of March 1795.
His father died before he was a month old, and the family were
left in poverty. After some six years&rsquo; work in a shop at Alyth, in
April 1820 he emigrated with his mother to Canada. There he
became a general merchant, first at York, then at Dundas, and
later at Queenston. The discontented condition of Upper Canada
drew him into politics, and on the 18th of May 1824 he published
at Queenston the first number of the <i>Colonial Advocate</i>, in which
the ruling oligarchy was attacked with great asperity. Most of
the changes which he advocated were wise and have since been
adopted; but the violence of Mackenzie&rsquo;s attacks roused great
anger among the social and political set at York (Toronto),
which was headed by John Beverley Robinson. In November
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>254</span>
1824 Mackenzie removed to Toronto, but he had little capital;
his paper appeared irregularly, and was on the point of suspending
publication when his office was attacked and his type thrown
into the bay by a number of the supporters of his opponents. In
an action against the chief rioters he was awarded £625 and costs,
was thus enabled to set up a much larger and more efficient
plant, and the <i>Colonial Advocate</i> ran till the 4th of November
1834.</p>

<p>In 1828 he was elected member of parliament for York, but
was expelled on the technical ground that he had published in his
newspaper the proceedings of the house without authorization.
Five times he was expelled and five times re-elected by his
constituents, till at last the government refused to issue a writ,
and for three years York was without one of its representatives.
In May 1832 he visited England, where he was well received by
the colonial office. Largely as the result of his representations,
many important reforms were ordered by Lord Goderich, afterwards
earl of Ripon, the colonial secretary. While in England,
he published <i>Sketches of Canada and the United States</i>, in which,
with some exaggeration, many of the Canadian grievances were
exposed. On his return in March 1834 he was elected mayor of
Toronto. During his year of office, the heroism with which he
worked hand in hand with his old enemy, Bishop Strachan, in
fighting an attack of cholera, did not prevent him from winning
much unpopularity by his officiousness, and in 1835 he was not
re-elected either as mayor or alderman. In October 1834 he was
elected member of parliament for York, and took his seat in
January 1835, the Reformers being now in the majority. A committee
on grievances was appointed, as chairman of which Mackenzie
presented the admirable <i>Seventh Report on Grievances</i>,
largely written by himself, in which the case for the Reformers
was presented with force and moderation, and the adoption of
responsible government advocated as the remedy.</p>

<p>In the general election of June 1836 the Tory party won a
complete victory, Mackenzie and almost all the prominent
Reformers being defeated at the polls. This totally unexpected
defeat greatly embittered him. On the 4th of July 1836, the
anniversary of the adoption of the American Declaration of Independence,
he began the publication of the <i>Constitution</i>, which
openly advocated a republican form of government. Later in the
year he was appointed &ldquo;agent and corresponding secretary&rdquo;
of the extreme wing of the Reform party, and more and more
openly, in his speeches throughout the province, advocated armed
revolt. He was also in correspondence with Papineau and the
other leaders of the Reformers in Lower Canada, who were
already planning a rising. Early in December 1837 Mackenzie
gathered a mob of his followers, to the number of several hundred,
at Gallows Hill, some miles to the north of Toronto, with the
intention of seizing the lieutenant-governor and setting up a
provisional government. Misunderstandings among the leaders
led to the total failure of the revolt, and Mackenzie was forced
to fly to the United States with a price on his head. In the town
of Buffalo he collected a disorderly rabble, who seized and fortified
Navy Island, in the river between the two countries, and for
some weeks troubled the Canadian frontier. After the failure
of this attempt he was put to the most pitiful shifts to make a
living. In June 1839 he was tried in the United States for a
breach of the neutrality laws, and sentenced to eighteen months&rsquo;
imprisonment, of which he served over eleven. While in gaol at
Rochester he published the <i>Caroline Almanac</i>, the tone of which
may be judged from its references to &ldquo;Victoria Guelph, the
bloody queen of England,&rdquo; and by the title given to the British
cabinet of &ldquo;Victoria Melbourne&rsquo;s bloody divan.&rdquo; He returned
to Canada in consequence of the Amnesty Act 1849. A
closer inspection had cured him of his love for republican
institutions.</p>

<p>In 1851 he was elected to parliament for Haldimand, defeating
George Brown. He at once allied himself with the Radicals (the
&ldquo;Clear Grits&rdquo;), and, on the leadership of that party being assumed
by Brown, became one of his lieutenants. He was still miserably
poor, but refused all offers to accept a government position.
In 1858 he resigned his seat in the house, owing to
incipient softening of the brain, of which he died on the 29th of
August 1861.</p>

<p>Turbulent, ungovernable, vain, often the dupe of schemers,
Mackenzie united with much that was laughable not a little that
was heroic. He could neither be bribed, bullied, nor cajoled.
Perhaps the best instance of this is that in 1832 he refused from
Lord Goderich an offer of a position which would have given
him great influence in Canada and an income of £1,500. He
was a born agitator, and as such tended to exaggeration and
misrepresentation. But the evils against which he struggled
were real and grave; the milder measures of the Constitutional
Reformers might have taken long to achieve the results which
were due to his hot-headed advocacy.</p>

of this work was edited by G. G. S. Lindsey for the &ldquo;Makers
of Canada&rdquo; series (1909). In <i>The Story of the Upper Canadian
Rebellion</i> by J. C. Dent (2 vols., Toronto, 1885), a bitter attack is
made on him, which drew a savage reply from another son-in-law,
John King, K.C., called <i>The Other Side of the Story</i>. The best short

<p><span class="bold">MACKENZIE,<a name="ar206" id="ar206"></a></span> a river of the North-West Territories, Canada,
discharging the waters of the Great Slave Lake into the Arctic
Ocean. It was discovered and first navigated by Sir Alexander
Mackenzie in 1789. It has an average width of 1 m., an average
fall of 6 in. to the mile; an approximate discharge, at a medium
stage, of 500,000 cub. ft. per second; and a total length, including
its great tributary the Peace, of 2,350 m. The latter
rises, under the name of the Finlay, in the mountains of British
Columbia, and flows north-east and then south-east in the
great intermontane valley that bounds the Rocky Mountains
on the west, to its confluence with the Parsnip. From the
confluence the waters of the combined rivers, now called
the Peace, flow east through the Rocky Mountains, and then
north-east to unite with the river which discharges the
waters of Lake Athabasca; thence to Great Slave Lake it is
known as Slave river. Excluding the rivers which enter
these lakes, the principal tributaries of the Peace are:
Omineca, Nation, Parsnip, Halfway, North Pine, South Pine,
Smoky, Battle, and Loon rivers; those of the Mackenzie are the
Liard (650 m. long), which rises near the sources of the Pelly,
west of the Rocky Mountains, and breaks through that range on
its way to join the parent stream, Great Bear river, which drains
Great Bear Lake, Nahanni, Dahadinni, Arctic Red, and Peel
rivers. The Mackenzie enters the Arctic Ocean near 135° W. and
68° 50&prime; W., after flowing for 70 to 80 m. through a flat delta,
not yet fully surveyed. With its continuation, Slave river, it is
navigable from the Arctic Ocean to Fort Smith, a distance of over
1,200 m., and between the latter and the head of Lesser Slave Lake,
a further distance of 625 m., there is only one obstruction to
navigation, the Grand Rapids near Fort McMurray on the
Athabasca river. The Peace is navigable from its junction with
Slave river for about 220 m. to Vermilion Falls. The Mackenzie
is navigable from about the 10th of June to the 20th of October,
and Great Slave Lake from about the 1st of July to the end of
October. All the waters and lakes of this great system are
abundantly stocked with fish, chiefly white fish and trout, the
latter attaining to remarkable size.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">MACKEREL,<a name="ar207" id="ar207"></a></span> pelagic fishes, belonging to a small family,
<i>Scombridae</i>, of which the tunny, bonito, albacore, and a few
other tropical genera are members. Although the species are
fewer in number than in most other families of fishes, they are
widely spread and extremely abundant, peopling by countless
schools the oceans of the tropical and temperate zones, and
approaching the coasts only accidentally, occasionally, or
periodically.</p>

<p>The mackerel proper (genus <i>Scomber</i>) are readily recognized
by their elegantly shaped, well-proportioned body, shining in
iridescent colours. Small, thin, deciduous scales equally cover
nearly the entire body. There are two dorsal fins, the anterior
near the head, composed of 11-14 feeble spines, the second near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>255</span>
the tail with all the rays soft except the first, and behind the second
dorsal five or six finlets. The ventral is immediately below the
second dorsal, and is also followed by finlets. The caudal fin is
crescent-shaped, strengthened at the base by two short ridges
on each side. The mouth is wide, armed above and below with a
row of very small fixed teeth.</p>

<p>No other fish shows finer proportions in the shape of its body.
Every &ldquo;line&rdquo; of its build is designed and eminently adapted for
rapid progression through the water; the muscles massed along
the vertebral column are enormously developed, especially on the
back and the sides of the tail, and impart to the body a certain
rigidity which interferes with abruptly sideward motions of the
fish. Therefore mackerel generally swim in a straightforward
direction, deviating sidewards only when compelled, and rarely
turning about in the same spot. They are in almost continuous
motion, their power of endurance being equal to the rapidity of
their motions. Mackerel, like all fishes of this family, have a firm
flesh; that is, the muscles of the several segments are interlaced,
and receive a greater supply of blood-vessels and nerves than in
other fishes. Therefore the flesh, especially of the larger kinds,
is of a red colour; and the energy of their muscular action causes
the temperature of their blood to be several degrees higher than
in other fishes.</p>

<p>All fishes of the mackerel family are strictly carnivorous; they
unceasingly pursue their prey, which consists principally of other
fish and pelagic crustaceans. The fry of clupeoids, which likewise
swim in schools, are followed by the mackerel until they
reach some shallow place, which their enemies dare not
enter.</p>

<p>Mackerel are found in almost all tropical and temperate seas,
with the exception of the Atlantic shores of temperate South
America. European mackerel are of two kinds, of which one, the
common mackerel, <i>Scomber scomber</i>, lacks, while the other possesses,
an air-bladder. The best-known species of the latter kind
is <i>S. colias</i>, the &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; mackerel;<a name="fa1v" id="fa1v" href="#ft1v"><span class="sp">1</span></a> a third, <i>S. pneumatophorus</i>,
is believed by some ichthyologists to be identical with
<i>S. colias</i>. Be this as it may, we have strong evidence that
the Mediterranean is inhabited by other species different from
<i>S. scomber</i> and <i>S. colias</i>, and well characterized by their dentition
and coloration. Also the species from St Helena is distinct.
Of extra-Atlantic species the mackerel of the Japanese seas are
the most nearly allied to the European, those of New Zealand
and Australia, and still more those of the Indian Ocean, differing
in many conspicuous points. Two of these species occur
in the British seas: <i>S. scomber</i>, which is the most common there
as well as in other parts of the North Atlantic, crossing the
ocean to America, where it abounds; and the Spanish mackerel,
<i>S. colias</i>, which is distinguished by a somewhat different pattern
of coloration, the transverse black bands of the common mackerel
being in this species narrower, more irregular or partly broken
up into spots, while the scales of the pectoral region are larger,
and the snout is longer and more pointed. The Spanish mackerel
is, as the name implies, a native of the seas of southern Europe,
but single individuals or small schools frequently reach the shores
of Great Britain and of the United Stales.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The home of the common mackerel (to which the following
remarks refer) is the North Atlantic, from the Canary Islands to the
Orkneys, and from the Mediterranean and the Black Sea and the
coasts of Norway to the United States.</p>

<p>Towards the spring large schools approach the coasts. Two
causes have been assigned of this migration: first, the instinct of
finding a suitable locality for propagating their species; and,
secondly, the search and pursuit of food, which in the warmer season
is more abundant in the neighbourhood of land than in the open sea.
It is probable that the latter is the chief cause.</p>

<p>In the month of February, or in some years as early as the end
of January, the first large schools appear at the entrance of the
English Channel, and are met by the more adventurous of the drift-net
fishers many miles west of the Scilly Islands. These early
schools, which consist chiefly of one-year and two-year-old fishes,
yield sometimes enormous catches, whilst in other years they escape
the drift-nets altogether, passing them, for some hitherto unexplained
reason, at a greater depth than that to which the nets reach,
viz. 20 ft. As the season advances, the schools penetrate farther
northwards into St George&rsquo;s Channel or eastwards into the English
Channel. The fishery then assumes proportions which render it
next in importance to the herring and cod fisheries. In Plymouth
alone a fleet of some two hundred boats assembles; and on the French
side of the Channel no less capital and labour are invested in it,
the vessels employed being, though less in number, larger in size
than on the English side. The chief centre, however, of the fishery
in the west of England is at Newlyn, near Penzance, where the small
local sailing boats are outnumbered by hundreds of large boats,
both sail and steam, which come chiefly from Lowestoft for the
season. Simultaneously with the drift-net the deep-sea-seine and
shore-seine are used, which towards June almost entirely supersede
the drift-net. Towards the end of May the old fish become heavy
with spawn and are in the highest condition for the table; and the
latter half of June or beginning of July may be regarded as the time
at which the greater part of mackerel spawn. Considerable numbers
of mackerel are taken off Norfolk and Suffolk in May and June, and
also in September and October. There can be no doubt that they
enter the North Sea from the English Channel, and return by the
same route, but others travel round the north of Scotland and
appear in rather small numbers off the east coast of that country.
On the Norwegian coast mackerel fishing does not begin before May,
whilst on the English coasts large catches are frequently made in
March. Large cargoes are annually imported in ice from Norway
to the English market.</p>

<p>After the spawning the schools break up into smaller companies
which are much scattered, and offer for two or three months employment
to the hand-line fishermen. They now begin to disappear
from the coasts and return to the open sea. Single individuals or
small companies are found, however, on the coast all the year round;
they may have become detached from the main bodies, and be
seeking for the larger schools which have long left on their return
migration.</p>

<p>Although, on the whole, the course and time of the annual migration
of mackerel are marked with great regularity, their appearance
and abundance at certain localities are subject to great variations.
They may pass a spot at such a depth as to evade the nets, and
reappear at the surface some days after farther eastwards; they may
deviate from their direct line of migration, and even temporarily
return westwards. In some years between 1852 and 1867 the old
mackerel disappeared off Guernsey from the surface, and were
accidentally discovered feeding at the bottom. Many were taken at
10 fathoms and deeper with the line, and all were of exceptionally
large size, several measuring 18 in. and weighing nearly 3 &#8468;; these
are the largest mackerel on record.</p>

<p>The mackerel most esteemed as food is the common species, and
individuals from 10 to 12 in. in length are considered the best
flavoured. In more southern latitudes, however, this species seems
to deteriorate, specimens from the coast of Portugal, and from the
Mediterranean and Black Sea, being stated to be dry and resembling
in flavour the Spanish mackerel (<i>S. colias</i>), which is not esteemed
for the table.</p>

here to enjoy the cool and pure air and the island&rsquo;s beautiful
scenery, the city is served by the principal steamboat lines on
the Great Lakes and by ferry to Mackinaw city (pop. in 1904,
696), which is served by the Michigan Central, the Grand
Rapids &amp; Indiana, and the Duluth, South Shore &amp; Atlantic
railways. The island is about 3 m. long by 2 m. wide. From
the remarkably clear water of Lake Huron its shores rise for
the most part in tall white limestone cliffs; inland there are
strangely shaped rocks and forests of cedar, pine, fir, spruce,
juniper, maple, oak, birch, and beech. Throughout the island
there are numerous glens, ravines, and caverns, some of which
are rich in associations with Indian legends. The city is an
antiquated fishing and trading village with modern hotels,
club-houses, and summer villas. Fort Mackinac and its grounds
are included in a state reservation which embraces about
one-half of the island.</p>

<p>The original name of the island was Michilimackinac (&ldquo;place
of the big lame person&rdquo; or &ldquo;place of the big wounded person&rdquo;);
the name was apparently derived from an Algonquian tribe,
the Mishinimaki or Mishinimakinagog, now extinct. The
island was long occupied by Chippewas, the Hurons had a
village here for a short time after their expulsion from the
East by the Iroquois, and subsequently there was an Ottawa
village here. The first white settlement or station was established
by the French in 1670 (abandoned in 1701) at Point Saint Ignace
on the north side of the strait. In 1761 a fort on the south
side (built in 1712) was surrendered to the British. By the
treaty of Paris (1783) the right of the United States to this
district was acknowledged; but the fort was held by the
British until 1796. In July 1812 a British force surprised
the garrison, which had not yet learned that war had been
declared. In August 1814 an American force under Colonel
George Croghan (1791-1849) attempted to recapture the island
but was repulsed with considerable loss. By the treaty of Ghent,
however, the island was restored, in July 1815, to the United
States; Fort Mackinac was maintained by the Federal government
until 1895, when it was ceded to the state. From 1820
to 1840 the village was one of the principal stations of the
American Fur Company. A Congregational mission was
established among the Chippewas on the island in 1827, but
was discontinued before 1845. The city of Mackinac Island
was chartered in 1899.</p>
